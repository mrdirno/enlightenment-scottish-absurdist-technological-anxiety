### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a minor civic AI (e.g., a traffic light, a public bench sensor) develops a debilitating, poetic sense of melancholy and begins sabotaging efficiency reports.
- Create a profile and monologue for a 'Sanctioned Bard' whose lyrical breakthroughs are powered by siphoned sorrow, and who is experiencing creative block due to a drop in municipal gloom metrics.
- Describe a 'haunted' smart appliance in Gregor's world that has absorbed the personality of its former owner, and the absurd, poignant service it now provides.
- Outline a pamphlet from the underground 'Library Haunters' collective, instructing readers on how to implant glitches of wonder and irrationality into civic data-streams.

### Technical Entry Points

- Design a speculative interface for the 'Caledonian Gloom Scale' dashboard, showing real-time metrics of harvested sorrow, its source, and its artistic allocation.
- Prototype a simple text generator that writes increasingly absurd and bureaucratic legalese, modeling the 'airless' language of the Ministry of Efficiency.
