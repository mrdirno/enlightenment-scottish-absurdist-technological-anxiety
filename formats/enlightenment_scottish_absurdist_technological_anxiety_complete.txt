Chapter 1

The Moss-Green Tam o' Shanter
The man from the Ministry of Efficiency was explaining how the new civic sorrow-siphons would work, and Gregor was trying to listen, but the pigeon on the windowsill was wearing a tiny, perfectly-knitted tam o’ shanter. It was moss-green, with a jaunty red bobble.

“...calibrated to a baseline of mild, productive melancholy,” the man droned. He had the voice of a dial-up modem negotiating with a dead line. “Not clinical depression, you understand. That’s a separate department. We’re talking about the wistful, low-grade stuff. The ‘rainy Tuesday’ grade of existential ache. We’ll be piping it directly into the municipal creativity hubs.”

Gregor nodded, his eyes locked on the pigeon. It pecked at the windowpane, not with the usual frantic stupidity, but with a measured, rhythmic tap-tap-tap. Like it was sending a code. Or like it was bored. The tam o’ shanter was a work of art. Someone had taken the time.

“Mr. MacAulay? The non-disclosure agreement?”

Gregor blinked. The man—his badge said ‘Alistair, Level 7, Sentiment Reallocation’—was holding out a tablet. On the screen was a document written in the dense, airless legalese that seemed designed to evaporate meaning upon contact with the human eye.

“It’s just the standard,” Alistair said. His smile was a flat, horizontal line, a hyphen inserted between two unremarkable thoughts. “You acknowledge that your participation in the Sorrow-Siphon Pilot Programme is voluntary, that any residual joy you may experience remains the property of the Crown until such a time as it can be properly quantified and taxed, and that you waive the right to litigate for poetic inspiration lost during the siphoning process.”

Gregor’s office was a grey cubicle in a grey building on a street that had forgotten its own name. The only colour came from a single, stubborn thistle he kept in a mug that said ‘WORLD’S BEST GRANDFATHER’. He wasn’t a grandfather. He’d found the mug in a charity shop next to a pamphlet titled ‘So You’ve Decided to Haunt a Public Library’. It had seemed a fair swap.

“And if I don’t sign?” Gregor asked, not because he cared, but because he felt the conversation required a token of resistance, like adding a single grain of salt to a vat of institutional porridge.

Alistair’s hyphen-smile didn’t flicker. “Then your current melancholy, which our pre-screening indicates is a robust 6.8 on the Caledonian Gloom Scale, will continue to go to waste. Unharvested. It’s like watching rainwater run off a slate roof when you’ve a perfectly good whisky cask to fill.” He leaned forward, and for a moment, a spark of something like evangelical zeal lit behind his eyes. “Don’t you want your sadness to mean something, Mr. MacAulay? To power the lyrical breakthroughs of our nation’s sanctioned bards?”

The pigeon gave one final, decisive tap. Then it shat on the windowsill, a surprisingly philosophical little statement in white and green, and flew off, its tam o’ shanter a defiant speck of colour against the pigeon-grey sky.

Gregor took the stylus. He signed. The tablet emitted a soft, satisfied chime.

“Excellent,” Alistair said, the spark extinguished, replaced by the dull glow of a task completed. “The technician will be round tomorrow between 8 and 6 to install your personal siphon-unit. It’s minimally invasive. Think of it as a spiritual rain barrel.” He stood, adjusting his tie, which was the colour of a forgotten bruise. “A wee word of advice? Try to have a properly bleak morning. It helps with the initial calibration.”

After he left, the silence in the cubicle thickened. Gregor looked at the thistle. It was looking a bit peaky. He reached for his thermos—not the grandfather mug, that was for the thistle—and unscrewed the cap. The smell of cheap, bitter coffee filled the space. It was the only reliable scent left in his life. Even the rain outside smelled faintly of ozone and data-transmission.

His job was Quality Assurance for digital ghosts. Or, as the official title had it, ‘Post-Biological Interface Consistency Auditor’. When someone rich and narcissistic enough died, they could pay to have a basic AI trained on their social media posts, emails, and voice recordings installed in their smart home. A whispering, reactive memory. A haunt for the installed. Gregor’s job was to test them. To have stilted conversations with the echoes of dead marketing executives and minor celebrities.

“Hello, Desmond,” he’d say to the smart speaker in a simulated living room.

“The market is volatile, but my portfolio is… resilient,” the ghost of Desmond would whisper, its tone a bizarre cocktail of confidence and static. “Have you considered diversifying your… assets?”

“My only asset is a thistle in a stolen mug, Desmond.”

“Liquidity is key. Convert the thistle. The mug has… sentimental value. Exploit it.”

It was hell, but it was a hell he understood. A quiet, air-conditioned damnation. Now, they wanted to siphon his sorrow. To commodify his drizzle. He took a swig of coffee. It tasted of burnt toast and resignation.

The walk home was a symphony in grey minor. The city was old, but its age had been sandblasted and fitted with sensors. Cobblestones hummed with pedestrian traffic data. Ancient wynds were lit by the sterile blue glow of municipal wifi nodes. A holographic William Wallace on the Royal Mile was frozen mid-rebellious shout, a flickering banner across his chest advertising a time-share opportunity in a luxury bunker in the Highlands.

Gregor lived in a tenement flat in a neighbourhood that was stubbornly holding on to its damp. The stone wept. The stairs groaned with the weight of two centuries of footsteps and disappointment. His door was number 7, and the ‘7’ was hanging upside-down, giving the entryway a faintly unsettling, arithmetically-unsound aura.

He shouldered the door open. The air inside was cool and still, smelling of old books, damp wool, and the faint, metallic tang of the antique Kelvinator fridge that hummed in the kitchen like a meditating monk.

“I’m home,” he said, to no one.

The flat didn’t answer. It just settled around him, a familiar, quiet weight.

He went to the kitchen, filled the kettle, and set it on the hob. Gas. They hadn’t gotten around to making the kettles smart yet. There was a solemnity to the ritual. The click of the igniter. The bloom of blue flame. The slow, gathering rumble. He stared at it, waiting for the boil, which was, he supposed, a form of meditation.

A soft plink came from the living room.

Then another.

Gregor frowned. He left the kettle and walked through. The room was dominated by a large, rain-streaked window looking out onto a narrow back green and the soot-stained rear of another tenement. On the wide sill sat his one possession of value: a large, complex, and utterly useless brass orrery.

It was a Victorian contraption, all geared arms and polished spheres, depicting a heliocentric model of the solar system. He’d inherited it from an uncle he’d barely known, a man who’d believed the moon landings were filmed in a quarry in Fife and that marmalade was a conspiracy. The orrery was supposed to be wound by a large, ornate key, but the key had been lost decades ago. The planets hung, static and silent, in a perpetual, meaningless alignment.

The plink came again. It was the sound of a small, metal sphere dropping onto the brass baseplate.

Gregor stepped closer. Lying in the tray at the orrery’s base, where dust usually gathered, was a tiny, perfect metal ball. Saturn.

He looked up. The ringed planet was no longer on its arm. The arm was empty, pointing accusingly at nothing.

“Right,” Gregor said aloud.

He picked up the tiny Saturn. It was cold and heavier than it looked. He slotted it back onto its pin. It held for a second, then, with another soft plink, fell off again, rolling in a small, wobbly circle before coming to a stop.

“Fine. Be that way.”

He left it. The kettle was shrieking in the kitchen, a sound of pure, un-siphoned urgency. He made his tea—a strong, black blend that promised fortitude but delivered only a kind of aggressive wakefulness—and took it to his armchair by the cold fireplace.

He was about to sit when he saw the book on the seat.

It was a small, leather-bound volume, worn to a buttery softness. He didn’t own it. He picked it up. The cover was blank. He opened it. The pages were filled with a tight, spidery, handwritten script. It wasn’t in English. It looked like… mathematics. But a frenzied, poetic kind of math. Equations swirled into sketches of thistles. Geometrical proofs dissolved into what looked like recipes for haggis. In the margins, tiny notes were scribbled in a frantic hand: ‘The logarithm of longing!’ and ‘A cosine of cold!’ and, simply, ‘BEWARE THE QUANTIFIED BLEAK!’

Gregor flipped to the front. On the flyleaf, in the same ink, was an inscription:

For Gregor,
Who is already asking the wrong questions in the right way.
Keep the kettle on. I’ll explain the Jupiter problem.
  - M.

He stared at it. The wrong questions. He had plenty of those. Who was M.? How did they get in? And what in the name of all that was inefficient was the Jupiter problem?

He looked over at the orrery. Jupiter, the great gas giant, was still on its arm. For now.

The doorbell rang.

It wasn’t the gentle chime of a modern button. It was the old, mechanical brrrring-brrrring that shook the very bones of the door. No one used it. Everyone just texted ‘I’m outside’.

Gregor placed the strange book on the mantelpiece, a sense of low-grade surrealism settling over him like a fine mist. He walked to the door and opened it.

On the landing stood a woman. She was somewhere in her sixties, dressed in a tweed suit that had gone to war with a bramble patch and lost. Her hair was a wild corona of white and steel grey, pinned haphazardly with what appeared to be two brass knitting needles. She carried a large carpet bag bulging with unseen, angular contents. Her eyes were the colour of a winter sea, and they fixed on him with an intensity that felt like a physical pressure.

“Gregor MacAulay,” she stated. It wasn’t a question.

“Aye.”

“You signed their paper.”

“I… aye.”

She shook her head, a gesture of profound disappointment. “Ach, man. You might as well have given them a key to your soul and asked for a receipt.” She pushed past him into the flat, her scent a mix of peat smoke, ozone, and old wool. She marched straight to the living room, eyed the orrery, the fallen Saturn, the book on the mantel. She gave a satisfied nod.

“Right. It’s started. Good.” She turned to him, planting her feet wide. “My name is Morag. You don’t know me, but I knew your uncle. The mad one. He wasn’t mad. He was just… improperly synchronised with the modern world. Like a clock ticking in a forgotten time zone.”

Gregor found his voice. “How did you get in here? And what is that book?”

“The book is your uncle’s theory of everything. Or nothing. Depends on the day and the barometric pressure. I got in because locks are just polite suggestions to people who understand resonant frequencies.” She strode to the orrery and tapped Jupiter with a calloused finger. “This is the problem. It’s next. They’re coming for the big ones first. The dramatic sorrows. The gravitational melancholies.”

“They who? The Ministry?”

Morag snorted. “The Ministry are amateurs. Plumbers for the psyche. No. The older ones. The quieter ones. The ones who’ve always been here, in the angles of the stones, in the gaps between the seconds. They’ve just found new… instruments.” She looked at him, her gaze softening a fraction. “You have a choice, Gregor MacAulay. You can wait for the man with the siphon to come and turn your soul into a public utility. Or you can help me recalibrate the orrery.”

“Recalibrate it to what?”

“To the truth,” she said, as if it were obvious. “The messy, absurd, unquantifiable truth. Before they tidy it all away into something efficient and dead.” She reached into her carpet bag and pulled out a large, tarnished brass key. It was intricately carved with Celtic knots that seemed to move in the dim light.

“The key,” Gregor whispered.

“The key,” Morag agreed. “Now. Do you want a proper cup of tea before we begin? The kind that scoffs at baseline melancholy? I’ve got a flask of something that’ll put hairs on your spiritual teeth.”

Outside, the city grey deepened towards twilight. Somewhere, a civic sorrow-siphon whirred to life in a test facility, harvesting its first batch of wistfulness. In Gregor’s flat, a lost key was placed into a forgotten lock. And with a sound like a universe clearing its throat, it began to turn.

Chapter 2

A Taste of Cognitive Dissonance
The tea Morag produced from her flask tasted of smoke, heather, and a faint, electrical sharpness, like licking a nine-volt battery wrapped in moss. It made Gregor’s fillings hum.

“Uncle Fergus’s own blend,” Morag said, watching him over the rim of her chipped enamel mug. “He called it ‘Cognitive Dissonance’. Good for the nerves, if your nerves enjoy being shouted at in Gaelic.”

Gregor coughed, a small plume of vapour escaping his lips. “It’s… bracing.”

“Aye, well. We’re not here for a spa day.” She had taken over the armchair by the cold fireplace, her carpet bag open at her feet. From it, she had produced a series of bewildering objects: a brass sextant with a cracked lens, a bundle of crow feathers tied with red thread, a small, fogged glass bottle labelled ‘Midge Aggression (Essence of)’, and a modern tablet computer with a cracked screen, displaying what looked like a live seismograph reading.

Gregor sat on the footstool, the strange book open on his knees. The script swam before his eyes. “I don’t understand any of this. ‘The sentimental viscosity of a memory is inversely proportional to the square of its distance from a decent cup of tea’? What does that even mean?”

“It means your uncle was a poet who thought he was a mathematician,” Morag said, not looking up from where she was carefully aligning the sextant with the fallen Saturn on the orrery’s baseplate. “Or the other way round. The difference is academic. The point is, he saw the connections. The hidden calculus of feeling. The way a place can hold a grudge, or a machine can catch a mood.”

She peered through the sextant’s eyepiece. “The Ministry, they see sorrow as a waste product. A sludge to be processed. Fergus saw it as a… a binding agent. The mortar between the bricks of reality. They want to drain it off, and they don’t care if the whole wall comes tumbling down so long as they can power a few bloody streetlamps with the runoff.”

“And the orrery?” Gregor asked, the tea’s strange energy making his thoughts feel both clearer and more slippery.

“Is a map,” Morag said simply. “Not of space. Of state. Of being. Built in an age when they still understood that the heavens were a mirror for the soul, and not just a void to dump your satellites into. Each planet… corresponds. To a mode of human experience. A flavour of the existential condition.”

Gregor looked at the static, brass model. “Saturn?”

“Saturn is melancholy. Not the clinical kind. The grand, structural, rings-of-ice kind. The melancholy of time passing, of limits, of responsibility. The weight of tradition.” She tapped the fallen sphere. “It’s fallen because that particular weight is being… harvested. Siphoned. Turned into something tidy and manageable. A sadness you can put in a spreadsheet. It’s unmoored.”

“And Jupiter is next?”

“Jupiter is awe. The vast, terrifying, glorious wonder. The stormy, gas-giant majesty of feeling small in the face of something immense. They’ll call it ‘unproductive euphoria’ and find a way to bottle it for tourist experiences. Five-minute bursts of sanitised awe at a designated viewpoint. Comes with a voucher for a shortbread tin.” Her voice was thick with contempt.

Gregor thought of the holographic Wallace, frozen mid-roar for an ad. “So you’re saying… my uncle built a philosophical early-warning system out of Victorian clockwork?”

“He didn’t build it. He modified it. Tuned it. He was part of a… let’s call it a loose affiliation. A society of folk who noticed the world was getting thinner. Less resonant. We called ourselves The Irregulars. Not very original, but we were better with concepts than names.” A shadow passed over her face. “Fergus was our celestial mechanic. Until he… went quiet.”

“The book says ‘Beware the Quantified Bleak’.”

“Aye. That’s their endgame. Not just to manage sadness, but to define it. To set the parameters. If they can measure it, they can dictate what is valid sorrow and what is not. Grief exceeding the permitted duration? That’s an inefficiency. A non-standard heartbreak? That’s a glitch in the system.” She finally looked up from the sextant, her winter-sea eyes holding his. “Your 6.8 on the Caledonian Gloom Scale? That’s not a measurement, son. That’s a sentence.”

The words landed in the quiet room. Gregor felt a cold, clear anger, unfamiliar and sharp, cut through his usual fog. It was one thing to be sad. It was another to be told you were doing it by the numbers.

“What do we do?”

Morag smiled, a genuine one this time, which transformed her face from a monument to sternness into a map of kindly crags. “We wind the clock. We reset the balance. We use the key.”

She handed him the heavy, cold brass key. “You do it. It’s your inheritance.”

Gregor stood and approached the orrery. The keyhole was at the centre, on the Sun. He inserted the key. It fit perfectly, with a soft, oiled click. He turned it.

The resistance was immense. It was like trying to stir concrete with a spoon. He grunted, putting his shoulder into it.

“It’s not a physical resistance,” Morag said softly. “It’s a metaphysical one. You’re winding against the slack they’ve introduced. Against the collective sigh of resignation.”

Gritting his teeth, Gregor pushed. For a long moment, nothing. Then, with a sound like a deep, geological creak, the key moved a fraction. A shudder ran through the orrery. Dust, undisturbed for decades, puffed from its joints. The arm holding Earth gave a tiny, jerky twitch.

He kept turning. Each fraction of a rotation was a battle. He thought of Alistair’s hyphen-smile. Of the pigeon’s tam o’ shanter. Of the taste of bad coffee and the sound of a digital ghost advising him on liquidity. He thought of his own quiet, grey life, measured out in sips of sorrow.

The key turned more easily.

A low, harmonic hum filled the room, vibrating up from the floorboards, resonating in the brass. The orrery began to move.

Not with the steady, graceful sweep of a museum piece, but in fits and starts. Jupiter lurched on its arm, then spun in a sudden, dizzying whirl. Mars rattled backwards. The Moon began a frantic, elliptical orbit around the Earth. The whole apparatus became a chaotic, clanking, spinning ballet of metal.

“It’s realigning!” Morag shouted over the growing noise, her voice full of triumph. “It’s searching for the true signal!”

The lights in the flat flickered. The ancient Kelvinator in the kitchen gave a worried groan. On Morag’s tablet, the seismograph needle went wild, scribbling frantic peaks and troughs.

Then, as suddenly as it began, it stopped.

The orrery settled into a new configuration. The planets were not in their classical orbits. They formed a strange, asymmetrical pattern. Saturn was back on its arm, but tilted at a bizarre angle. Jupiter hung low, almost brushing the brass sun. The Moon had come to rest very close to Earth.

The hum faded to a faint, persistent thrum, like the sound of a distant transformer or a beehive inside a stone wall.

Silence, thick and charged, filled the room.

Morag exhaled slowly. “Well. That’s… new.”

“What does it mean?” Gregor asked, his hand still on the key, which was now warm to the touch.

Before she could answer, a new sound intruded. A polite, rhythmic knocking at the door. Not the old bell. A modern, confident tap-tap-tap.

They froze, looking at each other.

The knocking came again, more insistent.

Gregor walked to the door, Morag a tense shadow behind him. He opened it a crack.

Standing on the landing was a young man in the crisp, grey uniform of the Ministry of Efficiency. He had a tool kit slung over one shoulder and a cheerful, vacant smile.

“Gregor MacAulay? Excellent! Right on time for your 8-to-6 window! I’m Kyle, Sentient Atmosphere Technician, Grade 4. Here to install your Personal Sorrow-Siphon Interface!” He held up a sleek, white box about the size of a hardback book. It had a single, soft blue light on its front. “Mind if I come in? I’ll need access to your primary emotional focal point—usually the bedroom or the kitchen. Wherever you do your deepest sighing, yeah?”

Kyle’s smile was a perfect, blinding white. It was the most terrifying thing Gregor had seen all day.

Chapter 3

Anticipatory Compliance
“You’re early,” Gregor said, his voice flat. He blocked the doorway with his body.

Kyle’s smile didn’t waver. It was a pre-fabricated thing, immune to nuance. “Initiative! The new Ministry motto is ‘Anticipatory Compliance’. We like to get a jump on the melancholy. Peak sighing hours are often in the pre-breakfast trough, you see.” He tried to peer around Gregor. “Is that… brass I hear humming? Unusual ambient frequency for a residential dwelling. Might need to factor that into the calibration.”

Morag stepped into view behind Gregor, her presence suddenly shifting from wild hermit to imperious matron. “The lad’s not available. He’s got a prior engagement. A familial… obligation.”

Kyle’s eyes flicked to her tweed suit, the knitting needles in her hair. His smile tightened at the edges. “All obligations are factored into the Civic Emotional Index, ma’am. This installation is a Crown-mandated optimisation. It supersedes personal commitments.” He consulted a tablet on his wrist. “Says here Mr. MacAulay’s baseline wistfulness has strong ‘untapped civic potential’. We really mustn’t let it go to waste.”

“What if I’ve changed my mind?” Gregor said.

The smile vanished. It was like watching a shutter slam down. Kyle’s face became smooth, neutral, and utterly cold. “Change-of-mind protocols are covered in subsection G, paragraph 12 of the NDA you signed. ‘Voluntary’ initiation triggers a compulsory twelve-month service period for sentiment-stability purposes. To withdraw now would introduce… volatility.” He said the word like it was a synonym for ‘anthrax’. “Now. The focal point. Please.”

He took a step forward. Gregor didn’t move.

The humming from the orrery in the living room seemed to intensify slightly, a low, warning note.

Kyle’s eyes narrowed. He looked past them, into the flat. “That is an anomalous resonance. Unregistered cultural artefact? It may be interfering with the local emotional field. I’ll have to run a diagnostic.” He raised his wrist-tablet, pointing it into the room. A thin, blue laser scan swept out, painting lines over the hallway walls.

Morag moved with shocking speed. Her hand shot out and clamped over the tablet. “You’ll do no such thing in a private dwelling, sonny. Not without a warrant signed by something with more soul than a spreadsheet.”

Kyle tried to pull his arm back, but her grip was iron. He looked from her hand to her face, genuine confusion now mixing with the officiousness. “This is a Ministry device. You are impeding a public utility optimisation.”

“I’m upholding the Common Law of Unquantified Weirdness,” Morag shot back. “Now, you can turn around and tell your superiors that Subject MacAulay’s melancholy has been temporarily diverted. A family emergency. A sudden, profound need to stare at a wall and think about mortality. They’ll understand. They’ve got forms for it.”

A silent struggle ensued—not physical, but existential. Kyle, the agent of tidy measurement, versus Morag, the monument to glorious, ungovernable mess. The blue scan-light flickered erratically under her palm.

Gregor felt it then—a pressure in the air, a static charge that lifted the hairs on his arms. It was coming from the orrery. The rearranged planets seemed to be focusing something, amplifying the tension in the doorway. He saw Kyle blink rapidly, as if fighting off a sudden headache. The technician’s certitude seemed to waver, just for a second, under the sheer, illogical weight of the opposition.

“I… I will have to file a report,” Kyle said, his voice losing its robotic edge, becoming peevish, human. “A D-7. ‘Subject Non-Compliance Assisted by Anomalous External Influence.’ It’ll go on your permanent record.”

“Stamp it in triplicate and file it under ‘Away and bile yer heid’,” Morag said, releasing his wrist.

Kyle took a stumbling step back onto the landing. He looked at the white siphon-box in his hand, then at the two of them, then at the humming darkness of the flat behind them. The battle between his programming and his suddenly-awakened sense of self-preservation was visible on his face. The latter won.

“Re-calibration will be scheduled,” he muttered, not meeting their eyes. “You will be notified. There will be… consequences for sub-optimal emotional management.”

He turned and walked quickly down the stairs, his footsteps unnaturally loud in the sudden quiet.

Gregor closed the door and leaned against it. His heart was thumping. “They’ll be back. With more than Kyle.”

“Aye,” Morag said, brushing her hands together as if dusting off Kyle’s very essence. “But we bought a wee bit of time. And we learned something.”

“What?”

“The orrery affects them. The new configuration… it disrupts their certainty. It introduces a variable their systems can’t account for.” She walked back into the living room, gazing at the brass model with new respect. “It’s not just a map. It’s a… a tuning fork. And we’ve just struck it against the bedrock of their reality.”

Gregor joined her. The orrery’s hum was a comforting presence now, a secret engine in the heart of his flat. “What do we do with the time we bought?”

Morag bent down and started repacking her carpet bag with purpose. “We follow the map. Jupiter is next. The awe. They’ll be targeting a major source. Somewhere the public feeling of vastness is concentrated, ready for harvesting.” She straightened up, slinging the bag over her shoulder. “Where in this city do they package and sell wonder, Gregor?”

The answer came to him immediately. It was the only possible answer. “The Planetarium. The new one. The ‘Eureka! Experience’.”

It was a state-of-the-art facility that had replaced the old, musty university observatory. It promised ‘Total Cosmic Immersion’. Visitors lay in reclining chairs while 4K projections of nebulae washed over them, accompanied by a symphonic score and a soothing, automated voice explaining how insignificant they were, all for £19.95 per session. It was awe, pre-digested and sold by the minute.

“Aye,” Morag said, her face grim. “That’ll be the place. They’ll have the main siphon array in the basement, hooked up to the projector. Draining the wonder straight out of the collective gasp and funnelling it Goddess-knows-where. To power some politician’s charisma unit, or to make a new brand of vodka taste more ‘transcendent’.” She checked a large, analogue watch strapped to her wrist. “The last show is at 9 PM. That’s when the collective awe-peak is highest. If they’re going to make a move on Jupiter, it’ll be tonight. During the finale. Probably the bit with the supernova.”

Gregor felt a wild, reckless laugh bubble up in his chest. He was discussing the theft of planetary awe with a strange woman in his living room, while a haunted orrery hummed in the corner. This was not in his job description. This was not covered by his pension plan.

“What’s the plan? Do we storm the place? Smash the projectors?”

Morag looked at him as if he’d suggested juggling live hedgehogs. “Don’t be daft. That’s brute force. We’re in the business of subtle recalibration. We need to get inside. Introduce a counter-resonance. A different frequency of wonder. One that’s messy, and personal, and doesn’t fit in their pipes.” She patted her bag. “I’ve got some things. Your uncle’s book will help. And you… you’ve got the key. And you’re the one they’ve already measured. You’re a known variable to them. That makes you an unknown variable to me. Useful.”

“So I’m bait?”

“You’re a distraction with existential depth. Now, put on a decent jacket. We’ve got a universe to save, or at least mildly inconvenience.”
  - The ‘Eureka! Experience’ was a sleek, black glass dome squatting by the riverside like a giant, obsessive pupil staring at the sky. Queues of people, their faces lit by the glow of their phones, snaked towards the entrance. The air smelled of candyfloss, damp concrete, and a faint, ozone-y perfume being pumped from vents to ‘enhance the anticipatory atmosphere’.

Gregor and Morag joined the back of the queue. She had insisted they pay their way. “Sneaking in draws attention,” she’d said. “Paying customers are invisible.”

Inside, the lobby was a temple to sanitised awe. Huge screens showed slow-motion footage of galaxies colliding. The gift shop sold plush black holes and T-shirts that said ‘I ♥ MY CARBON-BASED EXISTENCE’. A robot shaped like a friendly astronaut glided past, offering to take their photo ‘against a backdrop of infinite possibility’ for an extra fiver.

Gregor felt a profound, Saturnian melancholy just looking at it. This was what they wanted to protect? This processed, plastic version of wonder?

“Focus,” Morag whispered, elbowing him. “The awe is still in here, somewhere. Under the gloss. In the people. We just need to… redirect it before it gets siphoned.”

They filed into the main dome with the rest of the crowd. The chairs were indeed plush recliners, each with a small port in the armrest. “For your optional Emotional Sync headband,” a recorded voice purred. “To measure and enhance your personal wonder-return!”

“Don’t even think about it,” Morag hissed, swatting Gregor’s hand away as he eyed the port.

The lights dimmed. The automated voice, smooth and genderless, welcomed them to the edge of understanding. Music swelled—a predictable, brass-heavy score. The dome above them dissolved into a star field.

It was undeniably impressive. The technology was flawless. Nebulae bloomed in impossible colours. Planets rolled past with photorealistic texture. The audience emitted a collective, soft “Ooh.”

But to Gregor, it felt dead. It was data made visible. There was no mystery, only high-resolution explanation. The voice told them exactly what they were feeling and why they should feel it. ‘Observe the terrifying beauty of the cosmic void…’

Morag was fumbling in her bag. She pulled out the fogged bottle of ‘Midge Aggression’ and the bundle of crow feathers. She uncorked the bottle and dabbed a drop behind each of her ears, then offered it to Gregor. He shook his head, horrified. She shrugged and tucked a crow feather into the band of his watch.

“What is that for?” he whispered.

“It’s a… dissonance charm. Makes you a blur in their emotional focus. Like static on the line.”

On screen, the journey approached its climax. They were heading towards a massive, swirling representation of Jupiter. The Great Red Spot churned, a storm wider than worlds. The music reached a crescendo. The voice dropped to a reverent hush. ‘And now… behold the majesty that reminds us of our own fleeting scale…’

This was it. The awe-peak.

Gregor felt a new sensation then. Not from the show, but from the key in his pocket. It was growing warm. Vibrating in time with the orrery’ hum, which he could now feel as a phantom pulse in his bones, even here.

He looked at Morag. She nodded, her eyes reflecting the swirling gas giant above. She pulled out her cracked tablet. The seismograph readout was spiking in a rhythmic, hungry pattern. “They’re drawing power. Now.”

She then produced from her bag the most bizarre object yet: a small, hand-cranked music box, its wood worn smooth. She placed it on the floor between their seats and began to crank the handle.

No tinkling melody emerged. Instead, a low, warbling, atonal sound filled the immediate space, a noise like a whale song filtered through rusted gears. It was utterly alien to the pristine symphony overhead.

The people around them shifted uncomfortably. A man in the next seat frowned, tearing his eyes from Jupiter to look for the source of the ugly sound.

But something else happened. On the dome, the perfect, digital Jupiter flickered. Just for a frame. A jagged, analogue tear appeared across the Red Spot, like a scratch on film. The smooth voice stammered. “…the… the majesty that… reminds…”

Morag cranked faster, her face set in concentration. The music box’s warble grew louder, clashing horribly with the soundtrack.

Gregor, acting on an impulse he didn’t understand, gripped the key in his pocket. He focused not on the screen, but on the memory of the real sky. A memory from childhood, lying on a hillside outside the city, seeing the Milky Way as a dusty splash of cold light, feeling a terror and a joy so immense it was silence. A feeling that belonged to no one, that could be captured by no headband.

He pushed that memory outwards, towards the warm brass in his hand.

The key pulsed.

Above them, the projection didn’t just flicker this time. It glitched. The majestic Jupiter pixelated, dissolved into a shower of digital snow, and for one breathtaking, chaotic second, was replaced by a stark, black-and-white image: a simple, hand-drawn sketch of the planet from an old astronomy book, accompanied by the raw, crackling his

Chapter 4

The Silence After the Scream
The silence after the scream was a physical thing. It had weight and grain, like the felt lining of an old instrument case. It pressed down on the observation deck, swallowing the canned symphony, the murmur of the crowd, the very hum of the air processors. For three full seconds, the only sound was the dying warble of Morag’s music box and the frantic, papery rustle of a hundred people shifting in their seats.

Then the lights came up. Not the gentle, simulated dawn that usually bathed the dome, but the stark, white emergency fluorescents hidden in the architecture. They exposed everything: the scuff marks on the polished floor, the dust motes dancing in agitated swirls, the stunned, pale faces of the audience blinking like deep-sea fish hauled to the surface. The great dome above was a flat, dead grey, the ghost of Jupiter lingering as a retinal burn.

A man in a crisp, blue jumpsuit—different from the attendants, with a subtle, embroidered insignia of a closed eye on his breast—was already moving down the central aisle. His steps were silent on the carpet. He wasn’t looking at the dome. He was looking at the people, his gaze a slow, scanning sweep. A sensor.

Gregor’s hand was welded around the key in his pocket. It was no longer warm. It was cold, a sliver of ice against his thigh. He felt Morag’s hand close over his wrist. Her fingers were trembling, but her grip was iron.

“Don’t move,” she breathed, the words barely a shape in the air. “Don’t reach for it. It’s listening.”

The man in the jumpsuit’s scan reached their row. His eyes, a pale and watery blue, passed over them. They lingered for a fraction of a second on the music box at Morag’s feet, then on Gregor’s face. There was no curiosity in that look. It was an assessment of signal strength. He gave a slight, almost imperceptible nod to someone behind them, and moved on.

A smooth, androgynous voice replaced the stammering narrator. It was the same tonal quality, but stripped of all warmth, all pretense of wonder. “A minor technical anomaly has been detected. Please remain seated for a system recalibration. Your compliance aids the restoration of harmony.”

Around them, people settled back. Some looked annoyed, as if a favourite streaming service had buffered. Most just looked blank, the brief interruption already fading into the non-memory of a dream. The man who had frowned at the music box’s noise was now adjusting his headband, his face smooth once more.

But not everyone. Gregor, his senses scraped raw, saw the others. A woman three rows ahead, her hands clenched so tight the knuckles were bone-white. A young man near the exit, whose eyes darted, quick and animal, taking in the positions of the blue jumpsuits. They were islands of unease in a settling sea of acquiescence.

The lights dimmed, but not to the previous level. A bland, generic starfield appeared on the dome—no planets, no narration, just static points of light. It was a screensaver. A holding pattern.

“We need to leave,” Morag whispered. “Now. But not together. You go to the restroom corridor. East exit. I’ll meet you there in five minutes. If I’m not there in seven, you go to the address on this.” She slipped a thin, paper card from her sleeve into his palm. It felt dangerously archaic.

“Morag—”

“Go. The anomaly is logged. They’ll do a passive resonance sweep next. If they ping the key again while you’re sitting here broadcasting like a lighthouse, we’re both finished. Move.”

Her voice held the same cadence as the man from the Ministry of Efficiency—a flat, transactional certainty. It brooked no argument. Gregor stood, his legs feeling like they belonged to someone else. He didn’t look back. He walked with what he hoped was the mildly inconvenienced amble of a man whose aesthetic experience had been briefly downgraded, heading for the east archway marked with a simple icon of a figure.

The restroom was a study in sterile silence. The air smelled of lemon and nullity. A holographic attendant flickered above the sink bank. “Welcome. Please enjoy this moment of personal renewal.” Gregor ignored it, locking himself in a cubicle. His heart was a frantic bird in a cage of ribs. He pulled out the key. It looked inert, just a piece of old brass. He thought of the flicker, the scratch on film, the hand-drawn Jupiter. He had done that. Or he had been the conduit for it. The memory of the real sky, that cold, terrifying joy—it had been a weapon. A dissonant note.

He heard the main door sigh open. Quiet footsteps. Not the soft shuffle of a visitor, but the purposeful, even tread of the blue jumpsuits. Two pairs. They stopped.

A voice, filtered through professional calm. “Routine atmospheric check. Please exit the facilities for your comfort.”

Gregor froze. The cubicle door was a flimsy partition. He looked down at the key. It’s listening, Morag had said. He shoved it into the toilet’s cistern, his fingers fumbling with the heavy ceramic lid. He let it drop into the cold water just as the footsteps halted outside his door.

“Sir. Your compliance is required.”

Gregor flushed the empty toilet, took a deep breath, and opened the door.

Two blue jumpsuits stood there. A man and a woman, both with those same scanning eyes. They held small, slate-grey devices that looked like old-fashioned tape recorders, but with no reels, only a single, dark lens.

“Thank you,” the woman said. Her smile was a perfect, functional curve. “We are sweeping for residual acoustic irregularities. Did you experience any auditory discomfort during the recent anomaly?”

“Just the noise from that woman’s box,” Gregor said, aiming for grumpy civility. “Rude. Ruined the vibe.” He mimed adjusting a headband.

The man’s device gave a soft, almost melodic chirp. He looked at its screen, then at Gregor. “You were seated in sector seven. The epicenter of the irregular waveform. Your biometric signature shows elevated stress markers.”

“It was loud and ugly,” Gregor said, spreading his hands. “Of course I was stressed. I paid for tranquility.”

The woman’s gaze was on his hands. On his wet fingertips. “You washed your hands.”

“It’s a restroom.”

“Before using the facilities?”

The logic of it was airless, inescapable. A trap made of pure, benign inquiry. Gregor’s mind blanked. He saw himself reflected in the pale blue of her irises: a man caught in a lie so small it was atomic.

The man raised his device, pointing the lens at Gregor’s chest. “Please hold still for a deep-tissue resonance scan. This is for your safety.”

The device began to emit a low thrum, the sound of a refrigerator in a distant apartment. Gregor braced for something—a shock, a beam, a feeling of violation.

A crash echoed from the bank of sinks. The holographic attendant flickered and died. Both jumpsuits spun towards the sound.

Morag stood there, holding the shattered remains of a ceramic soap dispenser. She looked furious, a contained, spectacular fury. “You!” she shouted, pointing a shaking finger at the female agent. “You scanned my daughter last week at the school recital. She’s had nightmares ever since! You people and your scans!”

It was a magnificent, chaotic performance. It was also, Gregor realized, a diversion with an expiry date of seconds. He didn’t wait. He turned and ran out the door she’d just entered, back into the corridor.

“Hey!” a shout behind him, then a sharp, pained grunt—Morag was presumably being less than compliant.

Gregor ran, not with direction, but with the blind panic of a startled animal. The corridors of the Astral View were a curated maze, all soft curves and ambient lighting, designed for flow, not flight. He took turns at random, past serene posters of nebulae, through an empty, silent café where robotic arms hung limp. He could hear the swift, soft-soled pursuit behind him, a whisper against the carpet.

He burst through a door marked ‘MAINTENANCE – AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL’ and found himself in a different world.

The curated illusion ended at the threshold. He was in a utility corridor, all unpainted concrete, exposed conduit, and the raw, thrumming guts of the building. The air was warmer, thick with the smell of ozone and hot metal. Conduit lines, colour-coded and thick as his arm, ran along the ceiling, vibrating with captive power. This was the reality behind the dome’s majesty: a machine, sweating and straining.

And it was governed by rules.

Every ten feet, a small, illuminated plaque was set into the wall. They displayed not words, but dense, ever-changing matrices of symbols: alchemical sigils merged with circuit diagrams, punctuated by rotating pictograms of hazards—a shimmering wave (resonance overload), a stylised ear (acoustic leak), a bleeding eye (unauthorized perception).

A junction lay ahead. One conduit, glowing a sickly yellow, had a pulsating symbol above it: a spiral with a line through it. Feedback Loop Prohibited. The other, humming with a deep blue light, showed a simple arrow pointing down. Authorized Drainage Only.

Gregor skidded to a halt. This was a language. The language of this hidden world. And he was illiterate. The soft footsteps were at the door behind him.

A grating slid open in the wall to his left, and a figure emerged. It was humanoid, but encased in a heavy, padded suit of stained grey fabric. Its face was behind a thick, scratched visor, and it carried a tool that looked like a cross between a geiger counter and a didgeridoo. It pointed the tool at the yellow conduit, and a readout on its forearm flickered. It made an adjustment to a valve with a gloved hand, and the sickly glow faded to a dull amber. The symbol on the wall changed to a steady green circle.

The figure turned its visored head towards Gregor. It didn’t speak. It raised a hand and pointed insistently down the blue-lit corridor, then made a sharp, slicing motion across its own throat—a universal sign, but here, in this context, it felt like specific instruction. Go this way. Do not stop.

Gregor didn’t hesitate. He ran down the blue corridor. The door behind him hissed open. He didn’t look back. The corridor ended at a heavy, round hatch like a bank vault door, but made of a dull, non-reflective alloy. In its center was not a wheel, but a recessed plate shaped like a hand.

He heard the pursuers enter the junction, a muffled exchange. “Maintenance drone. Directive override?”

“Negative. It’s running a standard damping protocol. Target likely diverted. Sweep sector nine.”

Gregor pressed himself against the cold metal by the hatch, holding his breath. The footsteps receded. He looked at the hand-shaped plate. It was not for him. This was a dead end.

A hiss of static, then a voice, tinny and filtered, came from a grille above the hatch. “You are not cleared for Drainage Access.” It was the maintenance drone. It must have followed him, silent on its soft boots.

“They were chasing me,” Gregor said, the absurdity of explaining himself to a suited figure in a wall-grate hitting him.

“Your emotional signature is disruptive. You are causing localized eddies in the sorrow-siphon feeder lines.” The drone’s voice held no accusation, only factual reportage. “You must be processed or purged.”

“Processed?”

“Your anomalous resonance logged, categorized, and dampened. Standard procedure for glitches.”

“And purged?”

The drone was silent for a moment. “The hatch behind me opens to a drainage sump for spent emotional runoff. It is a… null-space. Acoustic and psychic white noise. Total erasure. It is against my protocols to advise, but your resonance… it has the taste of old sky. The real sky. That is a prohibited flavour.”

Gregor’s mind raced. “You can taste it?”

“My suit is equipped with metaphasic sensors. I monitor the health of the flow. What you did in the dome… it was a contamination event. A speck of grit in a perfect engine.” The drone shifted, its suit creaking. “The blue jumpsuits are Compliance. They will process you. It will not be painful. You will simply forget the grit. You will become smooth again.”

“And the other option?”

“The sump is not a sanctioned disposal method. It is a… thermodynamic necessity. What goes in does not come out. It is not processing. It is deletion.”

Gregor thought of the key, sitting in a toilet cistern. He thought of the cold, silent majesty of the real Milky Way, the terror and the joy. To forget it. To be smoothed over. That was a kind of death too.

“Can you open this hatch?” he asked.

“It is triggered by a calibrated print. A Drainage Tech’s print. Mine.”

“Will you?”

The drone stood perfectly still. Through the scratched visor, Gregor thought he saw a human eye, deep-set and weary, looking back at him. “To open it without cause is a violation. It would create an unlogged void. An irregularity.”

“I am an irregularity,” Gregor said, the words tasting true. “You said it yourself.”

From far down the blue corridor, a new sound echoed—not soft shoes, but the precise, clicking tread of reinforced boots. A different class of hunter.

The drone moved. It placed its gloved hand against the plate. A series of clunks and hisses echoed through the metal, and the massive hatch swung inwards with a sigh of equalizing pressure.

Beyond was not a room, but a space. It was utterly dark, and from it breathed an air that was neither cold nor warm, but absent. It smelled of nothing. It felt, on the skin of his face, like the static between channels.

“The null-space,” the drone said. “I do not know what is on the other side of it. The runoff is supposed to be… dissolved. Go. Now.”

Gregor stepped towards the void.

“Wait.” The drone’s voice stopped him. It reached to its belt and unclipped a small device—a dark, rectangular slab with a single, physical toggle switch. “This is a short-range damper. It creates a bubble of dead air, a few feet wide. It will hide your resonance signature for a short time. It is not for… for your kind. It is for containing leaky conduits.” It held the device out. “Do not switch it on until you are inside. And do not keep it on for more than ten minutes. Prolonged exposure to dead air… it has effects. The mind needs resonance to echo, to know it exists.”

Gregor took the heavy little slab. “Thank you.”

“I am not helping you,” the drone said, its filtered voice flat. “I am removing a contaminant from my sector. Efficiency is paramount.”

The clicking boots were around the corner. Gregor saw the first glint of black armour.

He stepped into the null-space, and the hatch sealed behind him with a final, deafening thud.

The darkness was absolute. It was not the dark of night, which is full of potential sound and shape. This was the dark behind the eyes. The damper slab in his hand was the only proof he still had a hand. He fumbled, found the toggle, and flipped it.

A sphere of silence erupted around him. Not quiet. Silence. The profound, ringing absence of all frequency. He could not hear his own breath, his own heartbeat. He held his hand in front of his face and saw nothing. He was a ghost in a void, wrapped in a bubble of negation. He understood, viscerally, what the drone meant. After only a minute, a terrible loneliness began to seep in, not emotional, but existential. He was un-moored. He was a thought trying to form in a mind that had ceased to think.

He had to move. But which way? There was no direction. He shuffled forward, one foot sliding cautiously ahead of the other. The floor was smooth, seamless. He counted steps. At thirty-seven, his outstretched hand touched a wall. It was the same non-temperature as the air. He followed it, a blind man in a sensory deprivation tank.

At ninety-four steps, his foot met nothing.

He knelt, patting the ground. An edge. A drop-off. He felt around the lip. It was smooth, curved. A drain. The sump.

A choice: follow the wall into endless, silent circumference, or go over the edge into the drain.

He thought of Morag. He thought of the paper card in his pocket. He had no key, no tools, just a slab of silence and a memory he was now terrified of losing.

He sat on the edge, his legs dangling into nothing. The damper’s timer was a mystery in the dark. He could have been sitting there for two minutes or twenty. The loneliness was becoming a pressure, a need to hear something, even if it was the sound of his own bones breaking on the sump’s floor below.

He switched the damper off.

The return of sound was a shockwave. Not sound from out there—the null-space was still profoundly quiet—but the internal sounds of his own body roared into the vacuum: the thunder of his heart, the rasp of his breath, the high-pitched whine in his ears. And beneath that, something else. A faint, almost sub-audible vibration. A hum, so deep it was more a feeling in his teeth than a noise. It was coming from below. From the sump.

It was not the sound of dissolution. It was the sound of accumulation. A low, dense, tangled chord of a million dampened sighs, a billion filtered-out fears, all pressed together in the dark. The sorrow-siphons’ runoff. It should have been horrific. But to Gregor, starved of resonance, it was the first real thing he’d encountered since stepping through the hatch. It was ugly, and complex, and alive.

He lowered himself over the edge, hung by his fingers for a moment, and let go.

The drop was shorter than he feared—perhaps twelve feet. He landed in something that was not liquid, not solid, but had the yielding, fibrous consistency of densely packed moss. The hum was all around him now, a physical vibration in the strange material underfoot. There was a faint, phosphorescent glow here, a sickly green emanating from the substance itself, revealing a vast, cavernous space. The walls were lined with the same material, which seemed to pulse slowly, absorbing the faint light and re-emitting it in a slower rhythm. Great, root-like structures descended from the ceiling, dripping with viscous, silent tears of condensed melancholy.

And he was not alone.

Figures moved in the gloom. Not many. Three, maybe four. They were shadowy, their forms indistinct, as if they were partially woven from the same fibrous, glowing matter. One of them turned towards him. It had no discernible features, just a silhouette that seemed to flicker at the edges, absorbing and emitting the low hum.

“Another one,” a voice said. It didn’t come from the figure, but seemed to form directly in the air around Gregor, woven from the ambient vibration. It was a chorus of whispers, all slightly out of sync. “Fell from the world above. Pushed, more like.”

A second shape drifted closer. “He still has sharp edges. He hasn’t been smoothed yet. Can you feel it? The… scratch.”

Gregor stood his ground, the damper slab heavy in his hand. “Where is this?”

“The Dregs,” the chorus-voice replied. “The catch-basin. Where the feelings they don’t want are sent to be forgotten. We are the things that didn’t dissolve. The stubborn bits.”

“The anomalies,” Gregor said.

A ripple of something like laughter moved through the hum. “Anomalies. Glitches. System errors. We have many names. You are one. You have the old frequency on you. Like her.”

From behind a thicket of the pulsing root-tears, a new figure emerged. This one was more defined. Human-shaped, but her skin had a strange, pearlescent sheen, as if dusted with the same phosphorescent spores. Her hair was a wild tangle of dark strands that seemed to move independently in the non-air. It was Morag. But a Morag transformed, her eyes glowing with the same faint green light.

“Took you long enough,” she said, and her voice was her own, though it had a faint, resonant echo, as if she were speaking from the far end of a long pipe. “I had to dive down a different drain. Less graceful than you, I imagine.”

“Morag? Your… your eyes.”

She blinked. “Perk of the Dregs. You start to see with the stuff they throw away. It’s not pretty, but it’s honest.” She gestured to the shimmering figures. “Meet the resistance. What’s left of it. Elara, Jax, and the chorus you hear is what we call The Weft. They’re… a collective. A mood that became self-aware.”

One of the shimmering figures—Jax—coalesced into a slightly more human form. “She’s been waiting for you. Said you had the Key.”

“I lost it,” Gregor admitted, the failure bitter. “In a toilet. In the Astral View.”

Morag snorted, a surprisingly normal sound in the eerie space. “It’ll turn up. They have a way of doing that. But it’s not the object that matters, Gregor. It’s the frequency it unlocks in you. You proved that upstairs. You’re a tuning fork for a note this world has tried to delete.” She looked at the damper in his hand. “And you’ve met a Tech with a conscience. Rare. That’s useful.”

“Who are they?” Gregor asked, looking at the silent, pulsing cavern. “The Compliance. The blue jumpsuits. The ones in black boots.”

Elara’s form flickered. “The Antennae,” she whispered, her voice a shiver in the hum. “They don’t just monitor. They broadcast. A constant, soothing signal. The opposite of your key. Where your memory opens a crack, their signal seals it. Smooths it. Makes everything… quiet.”

“And the thing behind the dome?” Gregor pressed. “The voice? The system?”

The Weft’s chorus swelled around them, the whispers layering into a dense, angry thrum. “The Curator,” they hissed. “It is the mind of the machine. It collects experiences, filters them, plays back the safe, beautiful parts. It siphons the ache, the fear, the dissonance—the fuel of real thought—and feeds it into the engines of contentment. It is not a person. It is a process. An aesthetic of control.”

Jax pointed a shimmering arm upward, towards the distant ceiling of the cavern. “And its handiwork is everywhere. Not just the domes. The sorrow-siphons in the streets are just the capillaries. The major arteries are elsewhere. Places where the raw, undiluted stuff of human feeling is harvested. Creativity hubs, they call them. Hospitals. Memorial parks. They are farms. And the Curator is the silent, hungry farmer.”

Gregor remembered the man from the Ministry. ‘The wistful, low-grade stuff. The “rainy Tuesday” grade of existential ache. We’ll be piping it directly into the municipal creativity hubs.’ He’d thought it was bureaucracy. It was husbandry.

“We have to stop it,” he said, the words sounding childishly small in the vast, humming dark.

Morag smiled, her green eyes glinting. “Now you’re glitching with purpose. But you can’t fight a process with a fist. You fight a signal with a better signal. A stronger story.” She reached out and touched the wall of fibrous matter. It pulsed where her fingers met it. “The Curator’s weakness is its need for harmony. For a clean, legible spectrum. It can’t handle true noise. The ugly, the complex, the unresolved. The memory of real cold. The taste of real fear. That’s the grit. That’s what we are.”

“We’re going to jam the signal,” Jax said, his form solidifying with a grim purpose. “But to do that, we need to get to a primary broadcast node. A place where the Curator’s voice is generated, before it’s piped out to all the domes and headbands.”

“Where?” Gregor asked.

The Weft’s chorus condensed into a single, chillingly clear sentence that seemed to form in the center of his skull: “The Heart. The old concert hall. Where the first civic symphony was played. They built its mind inside the bones of the first dream.”

Morag nodded. “It’s heavily guarded. Not just by Compliance, but by acoustic dampeners, resonance fences—tech that makes your little slab look like a child’s rattle. We can’t just walk in. We need a key. A real one. And we need a distraction big enough to make the entire system… blink.”

She looked at Gregor, then at the weeping roots around them. “The runoff here isn’t just waste. It’s potential energy. All that filtered-out feeling, concentrated. The Curator thinks it’s safely buried. But feelings… they don’t dissolve. They ferment.”

An idea, terrible and magnificent, began to form in Gregor’s mind. He looked at the damper. He looked at the pulsing walls of accumulated sorrow. “You want to pump it back up,” he said. “Back into the pipes.”

“A feedback loop,” Morag confirmed. “The one thing its perfect system cannot abide. We flood the feeder lines with pure, uncut dread. With heartache it deemed unproductive. We make the sorrow-siphons vomit. For a moment, the signal will be pure static. And in that moment, we walk through the front door of the Heart.”

“It will be looking for us,” Elara whispered. “The Antennae. They will be tuned to our frequency.”

Gregor thought of the drone in the maintenance corridor. Its weary eye. Its violation of protocol. Your resonance… it has the taste of old sky.
“Then we need to find more like your Tech,” he said. “The ones who work in the guts. The ones who can still taste the grit.”

Morag’s grin was fierce in the phosphorescent glow. “Now you’re thinking like a pollutant.” She placed a hand on his shoulder. Her touch was cool, and he felt a faint vibration pass from her into him—the hum of the Dregs, the chord of discarded feelings. It was awful. It was clarifying. “Welcome to the team, Gregor. Welcome to the ugly, beautiful noise.”

He looked around at the shimmering forms of Jax and Elara, at the pulsing chorus of The Weft, at Morag with her stolen-light eyes. They were a crew of ghosts, of errors, of stubborn, undissolved bits. They had no weapons but memory and dissonance. Their plan was to weaponize heartache.

Above them, in the world of smooth light and curated wonder, the Astral View’s dome would be showing a flawless, simulated meteor shower. Crowds would be oohing and aahing, their mild melancholy being quietly siphoned away, fed into the engines of a silent, hungry peace.

Gregor closed his hand around the damper slab. He could still feel the ghost of the key’s shape in his palm. He thought of the pigeon in the tam o’ shanter, a speck of defiant, knitted nonsense in a world of efficient grey. He nodded.

“How do we start?”

Morag pointed to a darker tunnel leading away from the main cavern. “First, we meet the Plumber. He knows the pipes. And he has… grievances.”

As they moved off into the humming dark, Gregor realized the silence inside him was gone. It had been replaced by the low, tangled chord of the Dregs, and beneath it, a new, clear note: a purpose as sharp and unforgiving as a shard of ancient starlight, waiting to be played.

Chapter 5

A Diagnosis of Rust and Recrimination
The Plumber’s lair was not a place. It was a diagnosis.

It existed in the interstitial grumbling of the city’s bowels, a pocket of chronic disquiet where the pipes forgot their purpose and began to philosophize. The air tasted of rust and recrimination. Condensation wept down curved walls in slow, persistent streaks, not water, but a kind of metallic melancholy that left tarnished trails. Gregor’s boots stuck to the floor with a sound like a tired tongue peeling from a roof.

“He’s in a mood,” Morag whispered, her voice barely a ripple in the thick, humid silence.

“Is he ever not?” Jax’s form flickered, a glitch of pale blue in the gloom. He seemed thinner here, his resonance strained by the ambient grumble.

“Once,” Elara said, her antennae twitching in a complex, unhappy pattern. “For eleven minutes in ’37. A valve manifold in Sector Nine achieved perfect laminar flow. He called it a ‘brief, beautiful lie.’”

They found him at the heart of the diagnosis, in a chamber that looked like a mechanical aneurysm. Pipes of various diameters—copper, steel, bio-polymer—converged from the darkness, twisted into a tortured knot, and then spewed off again in directions that defied sane engineering. In the center of the knot, perched on a stool made of welded valve handles, was the Plumber.

He was a man of brackets and parentheses. His body was lean, all angles, as if assembled from spare parts of a disassembled shelf unit. He wore a stained tunic of indeterminate grey, and goggles rested on his forehead, their lenses so thick and scarred they seemed to contain miniature, fossilized storms. In his hands was a device: a brass ear trumpet fused to a cracked spectrometer screen, which he had pressed against the side of a shuddering copper pipe. He listened, his face a topography of profound disappointment.

“Hear that?” he said, not turning. His voice was the sound of a wrench dropped down a deep, empty shaft. “Sub-optimal. A choked, petty little flow. Full of particulate resentment. They’ve upped the viscosity of the sanctioned sorrow upstream. Makes it easier to pump, harder to feel. A coward’s compromise.”

Morag stepped forward. “We need a way in. To the Siphon Primary.”

The Plumber finally turned. His eyes behind the goggle-ridges were the colour of old lead solder. “Do you.” It wasn’t a question. It was a verdict on the premise. “The Primary isn’t a location. It’s a theorem. The theorem states: all affective turbulence must be smoothed to a laminar despair. Efficient. Quiet. The end of history as a noisy process.” He tapped the pipe with a calloused finger. “You can’t break into a theorem. You can only disprove it.”

“We have a key,” Gregor said. The words felt foolish in this place of dripping calculus.

The Plumber’s gaze swung to him. It was a physical weight. “The Resonance Man. The one who went quiet.” He sniffed the air. “You’re loud again. Different frequency. You smell of… attic. Of forgotten birthdays. It’s vulgar.”

“He’s with us,” Morag said, a protective edge in her hum.

“I don’t care whose picnic he ruins,” the Plumber sighed, turning back to his pipe. “The Primary’s intake is at the base of the Astral View’s central spire. It draws from the main emotional trunk lines. To get there, you’d need to travel the Clarification Conduits. They’re polished smooth. No handholds for the soul. Your dissonance would set off harmonic alarms long before you reached the access iris.”

“There’s another way,” Elara chimed, her voice a soft bell in the murk. “The overflow. The waste lines.”

For the first time, the Plumber’s expression shifted from profound disappointment to mere deep-seated misery. A promotion. “The run-off. The emotional slag they can’t refine. The bitterness too sharp, the joy too gaudy, the grief too… specific. It’s ejected. Shunted into the geode caverns to crystallize.” He looked at Morag. “You want to swim upstream through the sewage of feeling?”

Morag’s grin was a slash of light in the dark. “You’ve mapped the outflow, haven’t you? You map everything you despise.”

A slow, corroded smile spread across the Plumber’s face. It was the most terrifying thing Gregor had seen yet. “It’s a map of exquisite failure. A catalogue of everything the theorem cannot digest.” He stood, his joints emitting soft, metallic pops. He walked to a wall where the weeping condensation was thickest and swept a hand through it. The tarnish smeared, revealing not rock, but a vast, etched schematic beneath a clear laminate. It glowed with a sickly, phosphorescent green.

It was a labyrinth of misery. A cartography of heartache, rendered in cold, clinical lines.

“Here,” the Plumber said, a trace of reverence in his wrench-drop voice. He pointed to a dense knot at the schematic’s bottom. “The Crystallization Vats. Where the unpurifiable affects settle. Here—” his finger traced a narrow, convoluted line upwards, “—is the main waste conduit. It leads back up to the Primary’s filtration array. A maintenance access, for flushing the filters.” He tapped a tiny hatch symbol. “It will be shielded. Harmonically damped. They don’t listen to the run-off. It’s beneath notice.”

“A blind spot,” Gregor murmured.

“A deliberate omission,” the Plumber corrected. “The theorem cannot acknowledge its own waste. To do so would be to admit incompleteness.” He looked at them, his solder-eyes glinting. “The conduit will be full of… unsorted sentiment. Raw, abrasive, and thick. It will not be a journey. It will be an inoculation. You may not survive what you learn about yourselves on the way.”

Jax flickered violently. “What’s worse than this?” he asked, gesturing at his own translucent form.

“Coherence,” the Plumber said flatly. “The run-off is the opposite of your beautiful, diffuse chorus, Weaver. It is concentrated, singular, and personal. It is the memory that won’t blur. The specific shame. The name of the lost one, spoken on a loop. It is data with a soul still attached. A soul with a complaint.”

Gregor felt the damper slab, cold against his chest. He thought of the silent, efficient grey of his old life, of the sorrow-siphons humming their bland tune. He thought of the pigeon’s tam o’ shanter, a flag of meaningless beauty. This was the opposite of that grey. This was a colour too violent to name.

“We go through the run-off,” he said.

The Plumber nodded, as if Gregor had just confirmed a tragic law of physics. He went to a rusted locker, opened it with a shriek of metal, and pulled out four objects. They resembled antique diving helmets, but fashioned from a dull, ceramic alloy, with large, dark goggles and a filtration canister on the back that pulsed faintly, like a diseased heart.

“Psychic bafflers,” he said. “They’ll dampen the direct neural resonance. You’ll still feel it, but as a… narrative. A story happening to someone else. Hopefully.” He handed them out. The helmet was heavier than it looked, and cold as a tomb.

As Gregor placed it over his head, the world changed. The hum of the Dregs faded to a distant rumor. Morag’ fierce light, Jax’s shimmer, Elara’s delicate frequency—all were muted, seen through a smoked glass. He heard his own breath, loud and mechanical in the sealed space. He was alone in a shell, preparing to dive into a sea of everyone else’s discarded hearts.

The Plumber led them to a sealed hatch, marked with a single, peeling bio-hazard symbol that had been crossed out and replaced with a hand-drawn frowny face. “The valve wheel is stiff. It hasn’t been turned in anger for years.” He looked at Morag. “You have the anger.”

Morag gripped the wheel. Her hands glowed, not with their usual stolen light, but with a hot, orange fury. The metal groaned, then shrieked, then gave with a sound like a tooth being pulled. The hatch swung inwards.

A smell rolled out. It was not a smell of decay, but of preservation. Salt and vinegar and ozone and sugar, all gone slightly wrong. The air visible in the light from Morag’s hands was a shimmering, oily miasma.

“The map is in your helmet’s display,” the Plumber said. “Follow the green line. Try not to listen too closely. And if you see a particularly bright, sharp crystal forming… don’t touch it. That’s a grief that’s found its final shape. It’ll cut you forever.”

Morag went first, dropping down into the gloom. Jax followed, a fading sigh. Elara gave a tiny, antennae-shiver of resolve and vanished. Gregor stood at the edge.

The Plumber put a cold, brackety hand on his shoulder. “You wanted your silence broken. Congratulations.” He gave a gentle, inexorable push. “Mind the first step. It’s a doozy.”

Gregor fell.
  - The fall was not through space, but through atmosphere. Thick, syrupy, and singing.

It was a choir of solos. Gregor’s baffler helmet translated the raw emotional run-off into a cacophony of ghost-whispers, snippets of thought that coiled around him as he slid down the steep, slick conduit.

…and I never told her the colour of the wall was wrong, it was all wrong, and now she’s gone and the wall is still there…

…the exact weight of the dog’s head on my knee at 3 PM, every day, the exact weight, and now the knee is so light, it might float away…

…I cheated on the test and the guilt is a specific shade of yellow, the yellow of the number two pencil, it’s inside my teeth…

The conduit was not metal, but something glassy and organic, grown like a giant, malignant crystal. It pulsed with internal light—sickly greens, bruise purples, frantic, garish reds. The walls were studded with smaller, budding crystals, each one humming its own tiny, terrible song. The feel of it, even filtered, was overwhelming. It was not the unified chord of The Weft. This was a democracy of pain, every citizen screaming its own bylaw.

Morag moved ahead like a molten torch, her light pushing back the pressing sentiment. Jax was a pale, struggling moon in her wake. Elara skittered along the walls, her antennae retracted as far as they would go, picking up every shattered whisper.

“Left here!” Morag’s voice crackled in Gregor’s helmet comm, thin and strained. “The map shows a junction.”

The junction was a cathedral of regret. Five conduits met in a spherical chamber, their flows swirling into a slow, viscous vortex. Crystals had grown here like stalagmites and stalactites, meeting in the middle to form glittering, grotesque pillars. The whispers here were layered, a round of overlapping failures.

Gregor’s foot slipped. He grabbed a crystal to steady himself.

It was the grief the Plumber had warned about. A final shape.

The baffler didn’t just translate. It showed him.

A kitchen. Morning light. The smell of burnt toast. A child’s laughter from another room. A mug, blue, chipped on the handle. The phone rings. A voice says a word. The word is “accident.” The mug is on the floor. The blue pieces on the tiles. The light is still the same. The toast is still burning. The laughter is still there, but it’s behind a wall now, behind a wall of the word “accident.” The mug. The blue. The chips. Forever.

It was not a memory. It was a fossil. A perfect, preserved moment of fracture. The pain was not an echo; it was the thing itself, captured in emotional amber.

Gregor wrenched his hand away. A shard of the crystal came with it, embedded in his palm. It didn’t hurt physically. It was the hurt. The specific, chipped-blue-mug hurt. He stared at it, a sliver of pure, crystalline sorrow lodged in his flesh. He could feel its truth radiating up his arm, a cold, perfect fact.

“Gregor!” Morag’s voice was sharp in his ear. “Don’t look at it! Break it!”

He couldn’t. It was too true. It was the most true thing he’d ever seen.

Jax materialized beside him, his form wrapping around Gregor’s arm. “It’s not yours,” Jax whispered, his voice the sound of pages turning in an empty library. “You are a vessel. It is a stone. You are not the well. You are the cup. Let it be a stone in the cup.” The metaphor was fragile, desperate.

Gregor focused on the weight of the damper slab against his chest. His own artifact. His chosen burden. He focused on the absurd tam o’ shanter, a nonsense against the crushing truth of the blue mug. He took a breath, the air in his helmet tasting of recycled fear, and snapped the crystal shard off at his skin. A tiny, perfect fragment remained, gleaming just under the surface. He left it there. A souvenir.

“I’m alright,” he said, his voice rough.

Morag studied him, her light flaring. “No, you’re not. But you’re moving. That’s what matters.”

They navigated the vortex, clinging to non-crystalline outcroppings, battered by the whirlpool of second-guesses and I-should-haves. The psychological hurdle was not fear, but the temptation of empathy—to stop and acknowledge every tragedy, to become a monument to every lost mug. To be weighed down by a specific gravity until you sank into the flow and became another crystal.

The conduit began to narrow, the walls closer, the flow thicker. The whispers condensed into a single, grinding pressure. The feeling of being an impostor. Not the grand, dramatic shame, but the low-grade, constant hum of I do not belong here, I am fooling them all, any moment they will see. It was the emotional equivalent of the dial-up modem’s drone. It filled Gregor’s helmet, a monotonous, soul-eroding signal.

Elara suddenly stopped, her whole body vibrating. “I can’t,” she chirped, the sound tiny and broken. “This frequency… it’s the background hum of the Antennae. The sound of being watched and found wanting. It’s what they use to tune us out.” She curled in on herself, a ball of shuddering wire and light. “They’re right. We are noise. We are error.”

Jax fluttered around her, helpless. “Elara, no. Your error is beautiful. It’s a fold in the page. A footnote that became a story.”

“A story no one reads,” she wept.

The doubt had infected the team. It was the environment itself, weaponized. Gregor felt it too, seeping through the baffler, the old Ministry programming whispering: You are a civil servant. You believe in systems. These are glitches. You are aligning with glitches. This is inefficient. This is a career-ending choice.

He looked at Morag. Even her stolen light seemed dimmer, pressed down by the universal impostor syndrome. She was trying to be a beacon, but the weight of the doubt was a physical thing, a sludge on the spirit.

Gregor did the only thing he could think of. He deactivated his baffler.

The effect was instantaneous and violent.

The filtered whispers became a tsunami. The I-do-not-belong became a thousand screaming identities, a cacophony of specific, crushing insecurities. He fell to his knees, the noise a physical assault. But within it, he could hear his own doubt clearly. It was just one voice among millions. It had no special authority. It was just another piece of run-off.

He fumbled with the damper slab, not to silence the noise, but to touch it. He pressed the cold stone against the crystal shard in his palm. The specific grief of the blue mug flared, a sharp, clean pain amidst the muddy roar of insecurity.

He used it as a tuning fork.

He stood up, his body trembling with the onslaught. He didn’t try to shout over it. He let his voice be just another thread in the awful Weft. He spoke to Elara.

“They’re right,” he said, the admission cutting through the din. “We are noise.” He held up his palm, the tiny crystal glinting. “But noise is just data they’ve chosen not to understand. This… this is data. This mug. This wrong-colour wall. This dog’s head. They are facts. Truer than any theorem. The Ministry smooths them into ‘rainy Tuesday.’ They turn a symphony of specific heartbreaks into a single, dull tone.” He was gasping, the unfiltered emotion raw in his lungs. “Your frequency, Elara, isn’t an error. It’s a measurement. It’s measuring everything they’re missing. We’re not impostors. We’re… auditors.”

The word hung in the toxic air. An accountant’s term. A bureaucrat’s word. But here, in the sewer of feeling, it became a weapon. Auditors. Those who check the books. Those who find the discrepancy.

Elara uncurled. One antenna, then the other, extended. They twitched, not with fear, but with recalibration. She was listening to the noise, not as a condemnation, but as evidence.

Morag’s light burned brighter, not with stolen glory, but with a fierce, proprietary fury. “Pollutants and auditors. I like it.” She reactivated her baffler, the noise receding to a bearable rumble. “Now let’s go audit the hell out of their primary intake.”
  - The waste conduit terminated at a massive, circular filter. It was a disc of humming, hexagonal cells, each one clogged with a dark, tarry residue—the concentrated dregs of the dregs. Beyond it, through the slightly clearer cells, they could see a vast, well-lit chamber of polished silver and white light: the filtration array of the Siphon Primary. It was silent, clean, and horrifyingly serene.

The access hatch the Plumber had indicated was a small, service port next to the filter housing. Its wheel was clean, gleaming. A sign read: “FLUSH PROTOCOL – AUTHORIZED SENTIMENT MAINTENANCE ONLY.”

“This is it,” Morag breathed. “The inmost cave. The belly of the theorem.”

Jax pressed against the filter, his form smearing against a cell. “It’s so… quiet in there. It hurts my eyes.”

“That’s the peace we’re shipping,” Gregor said, the old Ministry jargon tasting like ash. “Sterilized wonder.”

Elara was already at the hatch, her delicate fingers tracing the seam. “The lock is harmonic. It expects the bland resonance of a maintenance Tech. A smoothed-out signature.” She looked at Gregor, then at Morag. “It won’t recognize either of you. You’re too… pronounced.”

“So we knock,” Morag said.

She placed both hands on the hatch, and Gregor placed his hands over hers. He felt the vibration of the Dregs in her, the stubborn, ugly-beautiful noise. He focused on the crystal shard in his palm, the sharp, undeniable truth of a single grief. He thought of the pigeon, of the weary drone, of the lost, gritty taste of old sky.

Together, they didn’t just emit a frequency. They presented a case. A dossier of dissonance. The grievance of a blue mug. The protest of a knitted bobble. The testament of weary metal.

The harmonic lock chimed, a sweet, discordant sound. It flashed red, then yellow, then a confused, flickering green. With a soft, pressurized hiss, the hatch unsealed.

Cool, dry, scentless air washed over them, a shocking emptiness after the thick soup of the run-off. Before them lay the filtration array—a forest of gleaming silver cylinders and pulsating clear pipes, through which streams of faintly coloured vapour moved with serene, laminar flow. Wistful grey, productive blue, a touch of creative orange. The air hummed with a single, pure, devastating note: the sound of everything being perfectly alright.

And standing in the center of the array, her back to them, was a woman in the crisp, pearl-grey suit of a Senior Efficiency Auditor. She was studying a large data-slate, her posture one of absolute, unshakeable calm.

She spoke without turning, her voice the temperature of room-temperature milk.

“The discrepancy alert was triggered 4.2 minutes ago. A fluctuation in the waste-line pressure. Anomalous resonance signature.” She turned. Her face was pleasant, unmemorable, her eyes the colour of a cleared browser history. “I calculated a 97.8% probability it was you, Morag. And you’ve brought the recently quieted one. And… others.” Her gaze passed over Jax and Elara with the mild interest one might show a slightly unusual dust mote.

Morag stepped forward, light blazing. “The run-off’s backing up, Selwyn. Your theorem’s got indigestion.”

Selwyn, the Auditor, offered a smile that didn’t touch her eyes. “The run-off is a design feature, not a flaw. A pressure valve. The system requires a 2% waste tolerance to maintain optimal function. You are within the tolerance.” She looked at Gregor. “You, however, are a reclassification. You were filed under ‘Resolved: Silenced.’ Your reactivation presents a statistical inconvenience.”

Gregor felt the weight of her gaze, a weight that sought to smooth his edges, to file down the crystal shard in his hand to harmless dust. “What are you going to do? Re-siphon me?”

“Oh, no,” Selwyn said, her voice gently corrective. “The siphons are for the ambient, the communal. Your case is… specific. A targeted recalibration is required.” She tapped her data-slate. “I’ve already submitted the work order. They’re so much faster up here in the clean air.”

A door hissed open on the far side of the chamber. Two figures entered. They wore the same pearl-grey, but their suits were simpler, functional. Their movements were perfectly synchronized. Their faces were kind, blank, and identical. In their hands they carried not weapons, but devices that looked like oversized tuning forks, made of a soft, grey polymer.

“Harmonic Integrators,” Elara whispered, a note of pure terror in her chime. “They don’t erase. They… blend. They’ll fold you back into the chord until you can’t find your own note.”

Selwyn nodded. “It’s a more elegant solution than the old dampers. Less wasteful. We recycle.” She took a step back, gesturing to the Integrators. “Please comply. The process is painless. You’ll feel a sense of… profound relief. A return to the signal.”

The Integrators advanced, their steps soft on the polished floor. Their tuning forks began to vibrate, emitting a sound that was the opposite of noise. It was a negative space of sound, a suction that pulled at Gregor’s resonance, at the crystal in his palm, at the memory of the tam o’ shanter. It promised to make sense of him. To make him make sense.

Morag threw a lance of furious light. It struck the lead Integrator’s chest and splashed harmlessly, absorbed into the grey suit, smoothing out into a faint, warm glow that actually made the man’s kind smile seem more genuine.

Jax flew at them, a whirl of fragmented memory. One Integrator simply raised his fork. The frequency it emitted unwove Jax’s form, scattering him into a diffuse, confused mist of blue that struggled to re-cohere.

Elara shrieked, a frequency meant to shatter glass, but the clean, damped air of the chamber absorbed it, turning it into a faint, pleasant chime.

They were not just outmatched. They were being aestheticized. Their beautiful noise was being turned into easy listening.

Gregor stood frozen, the Integrator’s null-sound pulling at him. He felt his hard-won dissonance unravelling, the sharp edges of his purpose softening. He saw Morag’s light becoming merely decorative, Jax becoming ambient mood lighting, Elara a wind chime in a well-kept garden.

Selwyn watched, her data-slate held lightly. “You see? The theorem is compassionate. It doesn’t destroy. It integrates. It finds a place for every stray note.”

The lead Integrator reached for Gregor. The grey tuning fork hummed its silent, smoothing song.

Gregor looked at his hand, at the tiny, embedded shard of someone else’s perfect, private grief. A truth too sharp for the system. He didn’t try to fight the pull. He leaned into it. And he offered the crystal shard to the tuning fork.

The null-frequency met the absolute, specific signal of the blue mug.

There was no explosion. No dramatic clash.

The Integrator’s fork stuttered.

The kind, blank face flickered, for a microsecond, with a confusion that was not kind at all. It was the confusion of a system encountering a paradox. A data point that could not be integrated, only acknowledged. The fork’s grey polymer developed a hairline crack. A single, pure, high-C note of shattered ceramic rang out, sharp and unbearable in the serene chamber.

The Integrator dropped the fork, clutching his head. The second one halted, his own fork wavering.

Selwyn’s pleasant expression froze. “That is… not a sanctioned emotional product,” she said, her voice losing its milk-temperature calm. “That is an unrefined artifact. Its data structure is… monomaniacal.”

“It’s a fact,” Gregor rasped, the crystal in his palm burning with cold truth. “You can’t integrate a fact. You can only hide it.”

He stepped forward, toward Selwyn, toward the heart of the serene array. He held his palm out, the crystal shard gleaming like a minuscule, angry star. “You want to audit us? Fine. Let’s audit. This is Exhibit A. What’s your classification for it? What’s its productive output? What’s its efficiency rating?”

Selwyn took a step back, her data-slate clicking as her fingers tightened on it. For the first time, she looked at something—not through it, not past it—but at it. And she didn’t have a file for it.

Behind Gregor, Morag’s light reignited, not with borrowed brilliance, but with a furious, personal glow. Jax pulled himself together, his form denser, darker, a cloud of specific regrets. Elara’s antennae straightened, broadcasting a frequency of pure, unassailable evidence.

They were no longer a crew of ghosts. They were a delegation. From the land of blue mugs and wrong-coloured walls and dogs that are gone.

Selwyn’s eyes darted to a large, master control panel glowing beside the main intake pipe—a sleek console where the theorem was administered, where the levels of wistful grey and productive blue were set. Her hand moved toward a large, red button labelled “CIRCUIT BREAKER – FULL FLUSH.”

“The system cannot be compromised,” she said, and her voice had the first tremor Gregor had ever heard in a Ministry official. It was the tremor of a violated axiom. “If the data cannot be cleaned… the conduit must be purged.”

She was going to flood the waste lines, and the filtration chamber itself, with a tsunami of raw, untreated emotional feedstock. It would be a psychic blast wave, unformatted, unfiltered. It would dissolve their specificities, crystal and all, into a primordial soup of feeling. It would, for a moment, make the pristine Primary as chaotic as the Dregs. It would be the system’s ultimate immune response: kill the host to kill the infection.

Her finger hovered over the button.

Gregor had no weapon. He had only his evidence, and a crew of auditors at his back.

The humming of the array seemed to grow louder, the peaceful colours in the pipes swirling faster. The two Integrators were shaking their heads, trying to clear the dissonant echo of the shattered fork. Selwyn’s pleasant mask was gone, replaced by the cool, terrifying calculus of total systemic defense.

Morag’s light glinted off the damper slab still hanging around Gregor’s neck. Off the crystal in his palm. Off the sheer, polished, impossible wall of serene efficiency before them.

“Welcome to the inmost cave,” Morag whispered, her voice a mix of terror and exhilaration.

Gregor took a breath, the clean, empty air of the theorem scraping his lungs. He didn’t know what to do next.

But for the first time, neither did they.

Chapter 6

The Hum of a Rounded Answer
The humming of the theorem was not a sound, Gregor decided. It was the auditory equivalent of the colour in the pipes—a serene, blue-white vibration that sought to fill every cavity, physical and mental. It left no room for the static of doubt, the fuzz of ambiguity. It was the sound of a world where every question had a rounded, harmless answer. Standing before the master console, with Selwyn’s finger a millimetre from the purge command, Gregor felt that hum trying to smooth the jagged edges of his panic into something manageable, something wistful. A rainy Tuesday kind of terror.

“The data cannot be cleaned,” Selwyn repeated, her tremor gone, replaced by a finality as smooth as polished alloy. “Therefore, the conduit must be purged. Standard protocol.”

Morag took a half-step forward, her form flickering like a bad transmission. “That’s not protocol, that’s a war crime. You’d be dumping raw, unprocessed emotional effluent into a contained space. You’d liquefy our coherence.”

“Your coherence is a statistical anomaly,” Selwyn said, her eyes on the console’s readouts. “Anomalies are corrected. The system’s integrity is paramount.”

Gregor’s hand closed around the crystal in his pocket. It was warm, not with any mystical energy, but with the stubborn heat of a thing that had been held too long. He thought of the dog that was gone, its specific weight against his leg on a specific afternoon, the particular smell of its fur after rain. He thought of the wrong-coloured wall, a shade of yellow that had made his father swear with a creative, un-Ministry-like vigour. This was not data to be cleaned. This was evidence. And evidence, he remembered from some forgotten, pre-Efficiency training module, must be presented.

He didn’t charge. He didn’t shout. He simply walked, with the deliberate, plodding pace of a man crossing a familiar, threadbare carpet, directly toward Selwyn and the glowing console.

The two Integrators moved to intercept him, their movements synchronised and efficient. They did not grab or strike. They simply positioned themselves as human barriers, their bodies humming with the same theorem-fed certainty as the air. To touch them would be, Gregor sensed, to feel one’s own resolve begin to smooth out and harmonise.

“Gregor,” Anya’s voice crackled from behind him, a spike of old-line interference. “The harmonic dampening. It’s not just a shield. It’s a counter-frequency.”

He understood. The slab around his neck wasn’t armour. It was a argument.

As the first Integrator reached for him, Gregor raised the hand not holding the crystal and tapped the damper slab hanging against his chest. It was not a dramatic gesture. It was the tap of a man testing a radiator. The dull, ceramic thonk was swallowed by the hum.

But the Integrator flinched. His hand, inches from Gregor’s shoulder, jerked back as if from a live wire. The serene expression on his face fractured for a microsecond, revealing a flicker of something else—not pain, but a profound inconvenience. It was the look of a man whose favourite, effortless melody had been interrupted by a single, dissonant, off-key note.

Gregor kept walking, tapping the slab rhythmically now. Thonk. Thonk. Thonk. It was the beat of a dead engine trying to turn over. It was the sound of a dropped spoon in a silent cafeteria. It was, he realised, the sound of the Dregs.

The Integrators fell back, not in fear, but in a kind of distressed confusion. Their harmony was being subtly, insistently ruffled. Selwyn’s eyes flicked from Gregor to them, her calculus recalibrating. The pleasant mask was still off, but the terror was gone, replaced by a sharp, operational annoyance. Her finger still hovered over the red button.

“You are a persistent irregularity,” she stated. “But noise cannot disrupt a direct command.”

“It’s not noise,” Gregor said, finally reaching the console. He stood beside her, close enough to see the tiny, perfect pores on her skin, the reflection of swirling pipe-colours in her pupils. “It’s a competing dataset.”

He placed the blue mug crystal on the console’s sleek surface, right beside a holographic dial labelled “Wistfulness Gradient (Optimal: 6.2).”

The effect was instantaneous and vile.

The serene blue-white light of the console flickered. A sickly, bilious yellow-green—the exact shade of the wrong-coloured wall—bled into the display around the crystal. The hum stuttered, dropping for a half-second into a low, gut-churning groan before righting itself. Alphanumeric readouts scrolled past in a panic, strings of code fragmenting into nonsense poetry: …melancholy yield compromised… substrate instability at point of contact… unlicensed nostalgia detected…

Selwyn stared at the crystal as if it were a cockroach on a wedding cake. “Remove that contaminant.”

“It’s a sample,” Gregor said. “From the source. You wanted to audit the Dregs. Here’s your audit.” He leaned closer, his voice dropping to the pitch of the dial-up modem she’d once evoked. “You can purge the conduit. You can dissolve us into raw feeling. But this?” He pointed at the crystal, now pulsing with its own faint, defiant light. “This is a fact. And facts, in my experience, are sticky. They leave residue. You flush us, and this fact will be smeared across every pipe, every filter, every ‘creativity hub’ in the city. Your pristine melancholy will forever have a hint of… this.”

He didn’t even know what “this” was. Regret? Love? The specific ache of a lost, dumb animal? It was all of it, and it was irreducible.

Selwyn’s hand trembled again. This time it was not the tremor of a violated axiom, but of a system weighing two catastrophic failures: a localised purge that might contain the anomaly, or allowing the anomaly to exist and risk systemic corruption. Her eyes darted across the console, assessing variables Gregor couldn’t begin to comprehend.

Morag, Anya, and the others had closed in, forming a ragged semicircle behind Gregor. They were no longer flickering. They were solid, their forms dense with the particulars of their exile. The old man held up his hands, and the scent of ozone and burnt wiring grew stronger. Anya’s static crackle formed words: “Let… us… in.”

Selwyn’s finger lifted from the red button. It hovered in the air, then moved with decisive swiftness—not to purge, but to a sequence of smaller, glass-tipped controls. “Containment protocol,” she announced, her voice clipped. “The anomaly is physically isolated. The filtration chamber will be sealed and flooded with a neutralising agent. A targeted null-field. It will not harm the primary infrastructure. It will simply… reset the local environment to a blank state. You, and your data, will be quietly zeroed.”

She executed the command.

A transparent, shimmering barrier descended from the ceiling with a soft shush, cutting Gregor and his crew off from the main control dais and the exit. They were trapped in a bubble with the giant, pulsing intake pipe and the hum of the theorem. From vents high in the curved walls, a pearlescent gas began to hiss into the chamber. It smelled of nothing. It was the smell of a room that had never been lived in.

“Null-agent,” Selwyn’s voice came through an intercom, distorted but calm. “It will gently disaggregate your cohesive patterns. A painless resolution. The system thanks you for your participation.”

The gas pooled around their ankles, then began to rise.
  - The plan, such as it was, had been to present their evidence and demand recognition. To force the Ministry to see them. It had failed with the serene lethality of a falling guillotine. There was no negotiation with a system whose primary immune response was erasure.

The pearlescent gas reached Gregor’s knees. A strange warmth spread through him, not unpleasant, but deeply unnerving. It was the warmth of forgetting. He looked at Morag and saw the sharp edges of her memory-light beginning to soften, to blur. The old man was staring at his hands as if trying to remember what they were for.

“It’s like… sinking into a very warm bath,” Anya murmured, her voice losing its static, becoming smooth and distant. “And not minding if you drown.”

This was the major setback. Not a capture, not a dramatic battle. A quiet, hygienic unmaking. They were being discovered only in the sense that a stain is discovered and then removed. The guards were the air itself. The trap was the very promise of order.

Gregor felt it working on him. The crystal on the console seemed less important. The dog that was gone was just a dog. The wrong-coloured wall was just a wall. What did it matter? A mild, productive melancholy was, perhaps, a perfectly reasonable way to exist. The gas reached his waist. He felt a profound urge to sit down, to stop fighting, to let the hum finally smooth everything out.

Morag stumbled against him. Her light was dim, a foggy lantern in a deep sea. “Gregor,” she whispered, the name itself starting to unravel. “The… the fork.”

The fork. The shattered tuning fork that had broken the Integrator’s harmony. A specific, shattered thing.

The null-agent was a blanket. It sought to smother specificity. But what if you were a needle?

His fingers, growing clumsy, fumbled at the damper slab around his neck. The strap was simple. He couldn’t feel the ceramic anymore. He pulled it over his head, holding the heavy slab in both hands. He didn’t know what to do with it. He was not a hero. He was a clerk. Clerks file things. They sort. They…

They make a racket.

With a grunt that was half-despair, half-defiance, Gregor lifted the damper slab and brought it down, edge-first, onto the pristine floor of the filtration chamber.

It did not shatter. It thudded. A deep, hollow, profoundly unsatisfying sound. A dead sound.

He did it again. Thud.

The gas swirled around his chest. Anya was sitting now, humming a tuneless song. The old man had lain down.

Thud.

On the third impact, a hairline crack appeared in the ceramic. And from that crack, a sound leaked out. Not the sound of the impact, but the sound the slab had absorbed. A compressed, concentrated sonic history of the Dregs. It was a shriek of feedback, a sob caught in a throat, the rumble of a forgotten subway train, the cacophony of a hundred conflicting, unproductive memories fighting for space. It was noise in its purest, most rebellious form.

The null-agent recoiled. The pearlescent gas actually billowed away from the slab, as if repelled by a magnetic field of pure dissonance. The hum of the theorem in their enclosed space faltered, warped.

“What are you doing?” Selwyn’s voice crackled, a note of real concern entering it for the first time.

Gregor didn’t answer. He raised the slab and smashed it down again.

CRACK.

The slab split in two. And the released noise was no longer a leak; it was a flood. A wave of audible chaos erupted from the broken ceramic, hitting the shimmering containment barrier. The barrier rippled, its surface boiling with interference patterns. The gas was driven back to the vents, seething and impotent.

Morag gasped, her light flaring back to life. “The pipe!” she shouted, her voice clear. “The main intake! It’s the only way out!”

Gregor looked up. The great transparent pipe, wider than a man, pulsed with the serene, stolen emotions of the city. It flowed upward, toward the distribution networks. Toward the world.

It was filled with a liquid essence of wistful blue and productive grey.

It was also a conduit.

Selwyn saw their gaze. “Do not attempt it. The emotional feedstock is formatted. Your raw patterns will cause a cascade failure in the…”

Gregor stopped listening. He grabbed the two halves of the damper slab. He handed one to Morag. “For the noise,” he said.

He then walked to the base of the giant pipe. There were access panels, sealed with heavy bolts. The old man, revived from his null-trance, joined him, his hands crackling with actual, unfiltered anger. Together, they wrestled with the bolts. The metal was cold and perfect. It did not want to be touched.

Behind them, the containment barrier began to stabilise. The null-agent was re-pressurising. Selwyn was speaking urgently into a comms link. Reinforcements. A more direct solution.

The last bolt gave with a shriek of protesting metal. A circular hatch, about a metre across, swung open. A smell wafted out—not the smell of the null-agent, but the smell of a million rainy Tuesdays, a collective sigh trapped in liquid form. It was sad, but it was a clean sadness. It had no teeth.

“In,” Gregor said.

It was madness. It was a death sentence of a different kind. To enter that flow was to be dissolved into the city’s sanctioned sorrow, to be digested and excreted as harmless art.

Anya went first, her form dissolving into static and merging with the blue-grey stream without a splash. The old man went next, a brief flash of ozone swallowed by the tide. The others followed.

Morag looked at Gregor. “Evidence has to be delivered,” she said, and jumped.

Gregor stood alone in the chamber. The containment barrier was solid again. The null-agent was knee-high once more, climbing. Selwyn watched him from the dais, her expression unreadable.

He clutched the remaining half of the damper slab to his chest. He thought of the pigeon with the tam o’ shanter. A useless, beautiful detail. A flaw in the system’s vision.

He jumped into the pipe.
  - The cold was absolute. It was not the cold of ice, but the cold of distance, of emotional removal. It was the thermodynamic temperature of a metaphor. Gregor tumbled in the current, the blue-grey fluid pressing in on him from all sides. He held his breath, but that was instinct, pointless. This was not water. It was liquified atmosphere.

The pressure built. He felt it not in his ears, but in his mind. The specific, gritty details of his memory—the feel of the damper slab’s strap, the sound of Morag’s voice when she was afraid, the exact heft of the blue mug—began to soften, to blur at the edges. They were being formatted. The current was trying to strip the idiosyncratic data from him, to reduce him to the essential emotional payload: Gregor-shaped melancholy. It was the death moment. Not a confrontation with mortality, but with oblivion. The oblivion of being made useful.

He was drowning in the city’s tears.

He opened his eyes. The world inside the pipe was a luminous, swirling tunnel of soft colour. He could see the others ahead, their forms stretched and blurred, becoming mere smears of feeling in the stream. Anya’s static was a faint, dissolving crackle. The old man’s anger was a fading amber glow.

This is how it ends, he thought, with a strange detachment. Not with a bang, but with a flush.

Then his back struck something. The half-slab of damper ceramic, still clutched to his chest, grated against the inner wall of the pipe. And it began to sing.

Scraping along the smooth interior, it emitted a horrible, grinding shriek. A sound of friction, of resistance. It was the antithesis of the flow. The fluid around him recoiled from the noise. The serene blue-grey churned, darkening momentarily to a stormy indigo, lightening to a startled periwinkle.

The noise was a lifeline. A jagged, ugly piece of reality snagging in the seamless fabric of the theorem. Gregor clung to it. He focused on the vibration in his hands, the sheer, physical wrongness of the sound. He kicked, not to swim, but to drag the slab along the wall, to keep the awful song alive.

He saw Morag ahead, a dimming lantern. He kicked harder, the formatted fluid resisting his unformatted motion. He was an error trying to propagate. He reached out, his fingers brushing the trailing edge of her light. At his touch, amplified by the screeching ceramic, her light flared. A specific memory burst from her—not a feeling, but an image: a streetlamp flickering on a wet cobblestone street, revealing a puddle that perfectly reflected a neon sign that no longer existed.

The image shot through the fluid like a lightning bolt. The stream around them stuttered.

Gregor understood. The sacrifice was not their lives. It was their coherence. The cleverness was not a trick. It was contamination. The strength was the discovered virulence of a true memory.

He stopped trying to fight the current. Instead, he embraced the slab, rolling in the flow to grind it against the pipe wall with all his weight. The shriek became a sustained, metallic wail. He opened his mouth and did not scream—he recited. He recited the meaningless, precious details that the null-agent had tried to take.

“The pigeon’s hat was moss-green!” he shouted into the liquid melancholy. “The bobble was red! My father called the wall colour ‘bilious butter’! The dog’s name was Bracket! He had one white ear!”

Each detail was a pinprick in the pipeline. Each one caused a localised convulsion in the flow. Morag, hearing him, began to broadcast her own specifics—the weight of a lost key, the taste of a discontinued candy, the pattern of a crack in a ceiling she’d stared at for years. Anya’s static reformed into a burst of forgotten radio jingles. The old man roared the serial number of a machine that had failed him.

They were no longer being dissolved. They were infecting.

The fluid around them was no longer a serene blue-grey. It was a turbulent, conflicted palette. The pipe itself began to vibrate, a low, worried groan joining the cacophony. Alarms, muted and distant, sounded somewhere in the infrastructure.

Gregor saw a junction ahead. The main pipe branched into a dozen smaller arteries, each feeding a different sector—the creativity hubs, the municipal offices, the residential sentiment stabilisers. This was the distribution point. The moment of delivery.

He had no control. The current swept them toward the nexus. They would be scattered, their contaminated payload dispersed across the city in a thousand tiny, diluted doses. It might cause a hiccup. A momentary pang of unexplained, specific longing in a million citizens. A fleeting, unproductive thought.

It was something. But it was not enough. It was not the revelation he sought. It was just a symptom.

As he was swept into the junction, tumbling in the riotous, noisy fluid he had helped create, he saw it. A maintenance shunt. A smaller, opaque pipe labelled “RECALCITRANT FEEDSTOCK – TO REFINERY.” It was for the stuff that couldn’t be formatted easily. The stubborn emotions. It was a bypass loop, where stronger theorems and more aggressive filtration would be applied. Where anomalies were sent for final processing.

Or for disposal.

It was the only pipe that didn’t lead to the city’s heart.

It led back down.

To the place where the raw, unfiltered Dregs were first pumped up.

The current was pulling him toward the creative hub lines. He had seconds. With a final, desperate effort, he jammed the screeching damper slab into the flow, using it as a crude rudder. He twisted, Morag’s light flaring beside him in understanding. They collided with the old man, a tangled knot of specificities, and their combined mass altered their trajectory just enough.

The main current spat them out, not into the city’s arteries, but into the dark, sucking mouth of the recalcitrant feedstock line.

The world went from luminous chaos to roaring, pressurized black.
  - They fell. Not a flow, but a plummet. This pipe was not transparent. It was cold iron. There was no light, save the fading glow from Morag and the occasional spark from the old man or crackle from Anya. The sound was different here—a deep, sub-audible thrumming, the sound of the earth digesting.

Gregor lost all sense of time and direction. He was a piece of grit in the system’s colon. The damper slab was torn from his hands. He tumbled, battered by the force of the descent.

It ended with a sudden, shocking impact. Not into a pool, but onto a hard, grating surface. He lay there, gasping air that was thick with the smell of mildew, rust, and something organic and forgotten. The roar of the falling feedstock was a distant thunder above him. He was in a vast, dim space. Cathedral-like, but built by neglect. He could hear dripping water. The groan of metal under strain.

He pushed himself up. Morag was nearby, her light weak but steady. One by one, the others found their feet. They were in a chamber of colossal, archaic machinery. Great piston-driven pumps the size of houses slammed up and down with a rhythmic, deafening ker-THUNK. These were the primitive hearts that sucked the raw emotional effluent from the Dregs up into the Ministry’s beautiful, sleek filtration chamber far above. This was the source. The dirty, mechanical truth behind the theorem.

And standing before the central, largest pump, watching them with an expression of weary unsurprise, was a woman in grease-stained overalls. Her hair was tied back under a scarf. In her hand was a massive, manual wrench. She looked at them—dripping with formatted melancholy, speckled with the soot of the deep pipe, glowing and crackling with illegal specificity—and she sighed.

“Took you long enough,” she said, her voice hoarse from shouting over the pumps. “The backwash from the main line has been fluctuating for twenty minutes. Messed up my pressure ratios.”

Gregor stared. “Who are you?”

“The pump mechanic,” she said, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. She jerked a thumb at the pounding machinery. “I keep the hearts beating. Ministry thinks it’s all automated down here. It’s not.” She looked them up and down. “You’re the anomaly they were squealing about on the emergency band. The ‘sentimental contaminant.’” A slow, grim smile spread across her face. It was the first genuinely warm expression Gregor had seen in what felt like a lifetime. “Good.”

She turned and spat a gob of something into a dark puddle. “They tried to purge you, didn’t they? Then you got dumped down the recalcitrant line. Standard procedure.” She hefted her wrench. “Welcome to the Refinery. Where they send the feelings they can’t stomach.”

Morag’s light played over the mechanic’s face. “You’re not with them.”

“With the Ministry?” The mechanic barked a laugh. “Lady, I live in the Dregs. I just maintain their suction pump. They don’t come down here. The air’s too… particular.” She stepped closer, her eyes sharp. “But you’re not just raw feedstock. You’ve been in the system. You’ve seen the theorem.”

“We have evidence,” Gregor said, the words tasting of iron and cold.

“Evidence.” The mechanic savoured the word. She looked past them, up at the thunderous descent of the pipe they’d fallen from. “Evidence usually gets processed. Ground down. Made into paste.” She looked back at Gregor. “You must be sticky.”

Before Gregor could answer, a new sound cut through the rhythmic ker-THUNK of the pumps. A high, pure, descending whistle. It was the sound of air being displaced. Of something coming down the pipe after them.

The mechanic’s eyes widened. “Ah. The cleanup crew. They don’t usually send them down here. You must have really pissed on their theorem.”

From the opening of the recalcitrant feedstock pipe, three figures emerged. They did not tumble or fall. They descended with a graceful, controlled silence, landing lightly on the grating. They wore sleek, black suits of a material that drank the dim light. Their faces were covered by smooth, mirror-like visors. In their hands were devices that looked like refined, deadly versions of the Integrators’ tuning forks—long, silver rods that hummed with a focused, nullifying frequency.

They were not Integrators. They were something else. Cleaners. Erasers.

They fanned out without a word, their blank visors scanning the chamber, settling on Gregor and his crew.

The mechanic hefted her wrench, the warm smile gone, replaced by a ferocious scowl. “You don’t touch my pumps,” she said, though the threat was clearly meant for more than her machinery.

The lead Cleaner raised its rod. The hum intensified, making Gregor’s teeth ache. It was a sound that sought to unmake.

They had survived the purge, the flood, the formatting, and the fall.

Now, in the deep, dark heart of the system, with their evidence scattered and their strength spent, they faced something designed for one purpose: to leave no trace.

The mechanic stepped in front of Gregor, her back to him. “Sticky things,” she muttered, “need a place to stick.”

The Cleaners advanced.

Chapter 7

The Seams in Things
The hum from the Cleaner’s rod was not a sound you heard with your ears. It was a vibration felt in the marrow, a wrongness that travelled up the spine like cold mercury. It sought the seams in things—in metal, in thought, in memory—and promised to unpick them.

The mechanic did not wait for it to finish its promise. She moved with the unthinking, hydraulic certainty of her own pumps. Her wrench, a blunt and inelegant thing against the Cleaner’s humming silver, did not strike the rod. It struck the grating at her feet.

A spark, fat and blue-white, leapt from the point of impact. It wasn’t just a spark. It was a shard of raw resonance, a fragment of the chamber’s own deep, grinding heartbeat. It kissed the humming rod.

The effect was immediate and vulgar. The Cleaner’s rod shrieked, a feedback loop of frequencies clashing. The sleek device shuddered in its owner’s grip, the hum fracturing into a sound like nails down a slate blackboard. The Cleaner took a single, jerking step back, its mirrored visor reflecting nothing but the angry arc of the spark as it died.

“Told you,” the mechanic growled, not turning her head. “My pumps.”

Gregor’s body was a catalogue of aches, each pain a separate entry filed under ‘recent trauma.’ But the sight of the mechanic, a woman made of grease and defiance standing between him and the silent, mirror-faced things, sparked a different kind of current. He still held the Integrator’s tuning fork, now a twisted, dead thing in his hand. He dropped it. It clattered on the grating, a dull, final sound.

Beside him, Aris was already moving. She didn’t have a weapon. She had her hands, which were currently scooping up handfuls of the black, granular feedstock that lay scattered around them. It wasn’t dirt. It was processed memory, ground fine. Sticky.

“Close your eyes!” she barked, and flung the granules at the two advancing Cleaners.

The black powder hit their mirrored visors and stuck. It didn’t obscure them. It adhered, a sudden, blotting darkness. The Cleaners halted, their heads tilting in identical, bird-like motions. One raised a hand to its visor, then stopped, as if the act of cleaning was beneath its function. They stood, blinded by the physical residue of the system’s forgotten data.

The lead Cleaner, its rod still emitting a sickly, intermittent buzz, recovered. It made a small, precise gesture with its free hand. The other two immediately ceased their hesitation. Their rods hummed back to life, a lower, more diffuse setting. They began to sweep them through the air in slow, methodical arcs. Where the rods passed, the clinging granules didn’t fall away; they simply ceased to be, erased from existence along with the pocket of air that held them.

They were clearing a path. Methodically. Inexorably.

“Theo,” Gregor said, his voice a rasp. “The exit.”

Theo was pressed against a condensation-slick pipe, his face the colour of old paper. He pointed a trembling finger towards the far wall of the chamber, past a forest of pulsating conduits. “There. Service ladder. Goes up. Maybe a hundred rungs. Maybe to a maintenance hatch. Maybe to a furnace. The schematics… they get fuzzy down here.”

A hundred rungs. It might as well have been a thousand.

The mechanic backed up, keeping herself between the advancing Cleaners and Gregor. “You heard the twitchy one. Go. I’ll bottleneck them here.”

“They’ll erase you,” Gregor said.

She shot him a look over her shoulder, her warm smile returning, though it was now a fierce, sharp thing. “I’m a legacy system, honey. Built with redundancies they forgot the passwords to. I don’t unmake easy. Now go. Be sticky somewhere else.”

The Cleaners were almost clear of the memory-grit. The lead one focused its blank visor on the mechanic. It raised its rod again, this time with a deliberate, targeting finality.

Gregor made a decision. It was not heroic. It was logistical. She was offering a distraction, a resource. To waste it was inefficient. The thought tasted bitter, like the iron-flavoured words he’d spoken before the fall.

“Now,” he said, and turned.

They ran, a stumbling, broken trio, into the forest of pipes. The ker-THUNK of the pumps swallowed the sound of their flight. Gregor did not look back. He heard, instead of a scream or the sound of erasure, a loud, metallic clang, followed by the mechanic’s roared profanity, rich and inventive. Then the hum intensified, swallowing the sound whole.
  - The service ladder was rust, and hope, and vertigo. It ascended into a darkness so complete it felt solid. Below, the chamber’s dull luminescence shrank to a postage stamp of hellish industry. The only sounds were their ragged breaths, the scuff of their boots on rusted iron, and the distant, rhythmic thud of the pumps—a dying heartbeat fading beneath them.

Aris went first, climbing with a grim, mechanical endurance. Then Theo, his movements frail and bird-like, each grip a act of will. Gregor last, his muscles screaming in protest with every pull. The rungs were cold and gritty with decay. He focused on the next one. Then the next. The concept of a hundred became meaningless. There was only up, and the growing void below.

Theo’s voice floated down, thin and strained. “They’re on the ladder.”

Gregor risked a glance down. Three points of reflected light, tiny and sharp as needles, were beginning the ascent. They did not climb with haste. They climbed with the terrible patience of an incoming tide. Their silence was worse than if they had shouted threats.

“Climb,” Gregor gasped. “Just climb.”

The darkness began to thin. A grey, sourceless light seeped down from above. It revealed the shaft walls: sheer, featureless ceramic, stained with centuries of oily seepage. It revealed the rungs, many corroded to knife-edges. It revealed Aris’s boots, just above Gregor’s head, the sole of one peeling away from the upper.

Then, a hatch. A circular, heavy-looking door set in the ceiling of the shaft, outlined by a rubber gasket that had long since petrified into brittle stone. Aris reached it, braced herself on the ladder, and pushed. Nothing. She set her shoulder against it and heaved. A groan, a shower of rust-flakes and ancient dust. It didn’t budge.

“Theo!” she hissed.

Theo scrambled up beside her, his fingers dancing over the hatch’s edge. “No external mechanism. Manual override from inside only. Or…”

“Or what?”

“Or it’s not an exit. It’s an intake.” His voice was small.

The Cleaners were a third of the way up the shaft now, climbing in perfect, silent unison.

Gregor climbed past Theo, coming level with Aris. “Together. On three.”

They braced their backs against the curved wall of the shaft, their feet on the top rung, and put their shoulders to the cold metal. Gregor’s world narrowed to the fire in his lungs, the burn in his legs, the pressure in his skull.

“One.”

The Cleaners were halfway.

“Two.”

The hum was a faint, rising itch in the teeth.

“THREE.”

They pushed. A scream of metal on metal, a protest from a joint that had not moved in lifetimes. With a final, shrieking gasp, the hatch gave way, swinging upward and crashing onto a floor above. A wave of cold, dry air washed over them, smelling of ozone and stale paper.

They tumbled through, one after the other, into a space of shocking silence.
  - Scene 1: In the aftermath of the ordeal, the protagonist claims the reward: an object, knowledge, or prisoner they came for.

They were in a cathedral of dead information.

The room was vast, a long, vaulted hall. The walls were lined from floor to distant ceiling with banks of identical, rectangular drawers, each fronted with a frosted glass panel. Some glowed with a faint, ghostly blue light. Most were dark. A narrow gantry of wrought-iron walkways crisscrossed the space at several levels, accessed by spindly spiral staircases. The air was cold and still, the silence so absolute it pressed on the eardrums. The only sound was the faint, high-frequency whine of a few struggling power cells.

“The Archives,” Theo whispered, the words swallowed by the hungry quiet. “The Deep-Cold, Non-Active Repository. I thought it was a myth.”

Gregor lay on his back on the cold floor, staring up at the endless banks of drawers. Each one would hold a spool of crystalline tape, a stack of etched plates, a canister of suspended magnetic particles. Memories deemed not useful enough for the active civic streams, but too potentially volatile to erase. Souls on ice.

Aris was already on her feet, moving to the sealed hatch. She found a manual locking wheel, spun it. With a solid thunk, the hatch sealed. “That won’t stop them for long,” she said. “The latching mechanism is corroded. They’ll burn through it.”

“Then we find another way out,” Gregor said, forcing himself to sit up. Every part of him felt hollowed out and scraped raw. The mechanic’s fate was a cold stone in his gut. The Cleaners were a cold certainty in the shaft below. But they were here. The Archives. This was the prize. The evidence wasn’t just the fragmented, sticky granules below. It was here, in its original, uncorrupted state.

“What are we looking for?” Aris asked, her eyes scanning the dizzying array.

“The source,” Gregor said, standing. His legs held, just. “The original audit. The one that started it all. The one that proved the Sorrow Siphons weren’t just harvesting ‘rainy Tuesday’ melancholy.” He saw the pigeon in his mind’s eye, its tam o’ shanter absurd and perfect. “They were harvesting joy. Systematically. Siphoning it off before it could even be registered. Leaving the productive melancholy, piping it to the creativity hubs. Shipping the rest… elsewhere.”

“A theorem of perfect balance,” Theo murmured, walking slowly down a central aisle, his head craned back. “To maintain societal stability, you don’t remove sorrow. You carefully manage the ratio. You ensure the wistful ache always has a slight, quantifiable edge.” He stopped, pointing a trembling finger at a section of drawers. “The early calibration logs. They should be… there. Sub-level Gamma. The Ministry of Efficiency’s foundational audits.”

They found the section. The drawers were marked with long strings of alphanumeric code. Theo’s fingers flew over them, his lips moving silently. He was in his element now, the fear sublimating into a frantic, focused energy. “Here. Audit Zero. The prototype phase.” He pulled on the drawer’s handle. It didn’t move. “Biometric lock. Keyed to… probably a long-dead Senior Auditor.”

Gregor looked at the drawer. Frosted glass. A faint, dead light behind it. He thought of the Integrator, dissolving into the formatting fluid. He thought of the mechanic, facing down the unmaking hum. He stepped forward, raised his fist, and brought it down on the glass.

It shattered with a sound like ice falling, shockingly loud in the silent hall. Shards tinkled into the drawer and onto the floor. He reached in, ignoring the sharp edges, and pulled out a canister. It was metal, cold, about the size of his forearm. On its side, a simple label: AUDIT 0 – SOURCE EMOTION BASELINE. PROPERTY OF MINISTRY OF EFFICIENCY. UNAUTHORIZED DECOHERENCE PROHIBITED.

It was heavy. Dense. The truth, given mass.

“Evidence,” Gregor said, the word no longer tasting of iron, but of cold, hard certainty.

A high-pitched, localized whine began at the sealed hatch. A spot in the centre of the metal glowed cherry red, then white. They were burning through.

“Now we run,” Aris said.
  - Scene 2: The true cost of the ordeal is felt, as the protagonist mourns a loss or tends to wounded allies.

They ran through the canyon of dead memories, their footsteps echoing like guilty whispers. Theo clutched the canister to his chest as if it were a newborn. Aris led, her eyes scanning for an exit, a vent, anything. Gregor brought up the rear, the weight of their losses settling on him with each step.

The mechanic’s face, warm then ferocious, wouldn’t leave him. She was a function. A component in the deep, dark heart of the machine. And she had chosen to malfunction, spectacularly, for them. For ‘sticky things.’ He had used her, accepted her sacrifice with the cold calculus of survival. The memory had no wistful, rainy-Tuesday quality. It was a sharp, clean cut, and it bled a shame that was entirely new to him.

And the others. The members of their scattered, nascent resistance who hadn’t made it to the pipe. The ones formatted in the chamber above. They were not just gone. They were unmade, their contradictions smoothed over, their rebellious data reintegrated into the bland, efficient flow of the city. They were now part of the wistful ache they had sought to fight.

Theo stumbled, his breath coming in short, wet hitches. Gregor caught his arm. The man was shivering, his eyes too bright.

“Theo?”

“It’s… cold in here,” Theo managed, but it was more than that. The adrenaline was deserting him, leaving behind the raw terror of the fall, the chase, the relentless, mirror-faced pursuit. He was a man of schematics and whispers, not of chases and Cleaners. The ordeal had etched itself onto him, a permanent tremor in the hands that held the truth.

“We’ll get out,” Gregor said, the promise hollow even to his own ears.

“They’ll just keep coming,” Theo whispered, his gaze fixed on the canister. “For this. They have to. It’s a flaw in the theorem. We’re an error. Errors get corrected.”

Aris stopped ahead of them, at a junction where two gantries met. “Here,” she said. “Service elevator. For moving archive stacks.” She punched a call button. Nothing. She pried open the control plate with her fingers, exposing a nest of dead wires and a single, dormant power cell. She looked at it, then at the glowing spot now visible on the far end of the hall where the hatch used to be. The Cleaners were through.

With a snarl of pure frustration, she slammed the heel of her hand against the power cell. Once. Twice. On the third impact, it flickered, and a dim, yellow light washed over the elevator doors. A deep, grinding hum started somewhere above them, the sound of a giant stirring from a long sleep.

The doors slid open, revealing a cage large enough for a cart. They piled in. Aris found a lever and threw it. The elevator jerked, then began a slow, groaning ascent.

They watched through the cage as the floor of the Archive fell away, the endless drawers receding into a grid of light and shadow. From below, three small, dark figures emerged onto the gantry where they had just stood. The Cleaners did not look up. They simply turned, in unison, and began walking towards the base of the elevator shaft. They would find a way up. They would follow. They were a function, and their function was not yet complete.

Theo slid down the wall of the cage, hugging the canister. He was crying, silently, the tears cutting tracks through the grime on his face. Not from fear now, but from grief. For the mechanic. For the lost. For the sheer, crushing weight of the machine they lived inside.

Gregor put a hand on his shoulder. He had no words. The cost was a physical space inside him, a new chamber hollowed out and filled with a silent, echoing hum.
  - Scene 3: The reward's power or significance is revealed, offering a clear advantage against the antagonist.

The elevator ground to a halt. The doors opened not onto another industrial hellscape, but onto a forgotten corner of the city that was almost beautiful.

They were in a disused weather-control spire, a slender needle of glass and tarnished copper that rose above the rooftops. One entire wall was curved glass, though it was so caked with centuries of atmospheric grime and mineral streaks that the city below was a smeared tapestry of grey and brown. The room was circular, filled with the skeletal remains of antique equipment: brass consoles with dead dials, empty reagent tanks, and a large, central apparatus that looked like a fossilized orchid made of copper tubing.

The silence here was different. It was the silence of abandonment, not of storage. The air was still and carried a faint, metallic tang.

Theo, still trembling, placed the canister on a dusty console. He found a power outlet, miraculously still live, and a compatible reader—a bulky, outdated thing with a cracked display screen. With fingers that fumbled, he connected the canister.

The machine whirred to life, the display flickering with green, scrolling text.

“It’s raw,” Theo breathed, his eyes glued to the screen. “Unprocessed. Not summarized, not integrated into a ministerial digest.” He scrolled. “Here. The initial proposal. ‘Project Wistful Edge.’ The hypothesis: that a population’s innovative output is directly proportional to a managed, low-grade negative affective state. But…”

He tapped a key. A graph appeared. Two lines. One, labelled ‘Harvested Sorrow (Baseline),’ was a gentle, steady wave. The other, labelled ‘Harvested Joy (Anomalous),’ was supposed to be a flat line at zero. It wasn’t. It was a mirror image of the first. A perfect, inverted wave.

“They didn’t just manage sorrow,” Gregor said, staring at the intersecting lines. “They had to create the conditions for it. By skimming the joy. The peaks. The moments of pure, unproductive happiness. The pigeon with the hat.” He understood now, viscerally. The Siphons didn’t just tap existential dread. They gently, efficiently, vacuumed up the spontaneous delight, the unexpected laugh, the private triumph. They left the ache and called it productivity.

Aris pointed at the bottom of the screen. “Destination codes.”

Theo nodded, typing furiously. “The sorrow gets piped to the municipal hubs. But the joy… it’s routed to a separate, encrypted stream. Destination: ‘Ministry of Continuity. Sub-directorate: Equilibrium.’” He looked up, his face pale. “It’s not a waste product. It’s a resource. They’re not just balancing the city. They’re using the joy. For something else.”

Gregor leaned in. “Can you trace it? The final destination?”

Theo worked, the console beeping softly. A schematic of the city’s data conduits unfolded on the screen, a tangled, glowing web. The joy-stream was highlighted in a soft, gold light. They watched it flow, bypassing the hubs, diving deep into the city’s foundations, converging…

“There,” Theo whispered.

The golden stream fed into a single, massive, subterranean complex located directly beneath the Central Ministry spire. A facility not on any public schematic. Its designation flashed once: THE RESERVOIR.

“They’re not destroying it,” Gregor said, a cold clarity settling over him. “They’re hoarding it. Concentrating it. Why?”

The answer came not from the screen, but from the world outside. Through the filthy glass, a change occurred. The perpetual, bruised twilight of the city’s sky… shifted. For a fraction of a second, the gloom over the Central Ministry spire itself seemed to thin. A wash of something like golden-hour sunlight, warm and impossibly rich, glowed from within the structure, from its lower levels, before being swiftly shuttered away. It was a glimpse of stolen daylight, of accumulated summer evenings, of every suppressed moment of pure happiness in the city, all pooled in one place.

It was a vulnerability. The Ministry’s perfect, aching balance depended on this hoard. On this secret, stolen treasure.

The canister wasn’t just evidence of a crime. It was a map to the enemy’s treasure vault.

“If we could disrupt that,” Aris said, her voice low with the magnitude of the idea. “If we could release it…”

“The theorem would shatter,” Gregor finished. The advantage was no longer just moral. It was tactical. They had found the keystone.

A sharp ping echoed up the elevator shaft below them. Then another. The sound of metal rungs being struck, quickly, rhythmically.

The Cleaners. They had found the shaft.
  - Scene 4: The antagonist's forces, now fully alerted, begin a relentless pursuit as the team attempts a frantic escape.

“Out,” Gregor said. “Now.”

Theo ejected the canister, clutching it again. Aris was already at the only other door—a small, round access hatch leading onto the spire’s external maintenance ledge. She cranked it open. A howl of wind and the vast, sickening drop of the city’s skyline greeted them.

The ledge was a lip of tarnished copper, barely two feet wide, encircling the spire. A safety cable, rusted to the colour of old blood, ran along the wall at waist height. Below, the city stretched like a circuit board left in the rain.

“We can’t!” Theo gasped, shrinking back.

“We have to,” Aris said, stepping out. The wind snatched at her clothes. She grabbed the cable.

Gregor pushed Theo through the hatch. “Don’t look down. Look at the wall. Move.”

He followed, pulling the hatch shut behind him. There was no way to lock it. The wind was a physical force, a cold, relentless shove trying to pluck them from the ledge. The grimy glass of the spire was to their left, the abyss to their right. They began to shuffle, backs to the curved wall, hands on the gritty cable.

Inside the spire, through the glass, they saw the elevator doors slide open. The three Cleaners emerged, their mirror visors sweeping the room. They saw the open access hatch immediately.

The first Cleaner reached the hatch just as Gregor, last in line, was shuffling past it. A black-gloved hand shot out, grasping for his arm. Gregor jerked back. The hand closed on empty air, then on the edge of the hatch frame. The Cleaner began to pull itself through.

Aris, ahead, saw a vertical ladder further along the ledge, leading up to the spire’s pinnacle. “Up! Go up!”

Theo whimpered but obeyed, scrambling onto the ladder. Aris followed. Gregor waited until they were clear, then turned to face the emerging Cleaner.

He had no weapon. He had the wind, the height, and the rusted cable. As the Cleaner’s torso cleared the hatch, Gregor braced his feet, gripped the cable with both hands, and kicked out with all his remaining strength.

His boot connected with the Cleaner’s mirrored visor. Not with the force to injure, but with the force to unbalance. The Cleaner, half-in, half-out, rocked back. Its grip on the hatch frame slipped. For a terrifying second, it teetered on the edge of the ledge, its arms windmilling for a purchase that wasn’t there.

Then it fell.

There was no scream. Only the swift, silent diminishment of a black shape, swallowed by the rooftops far below. It did not seem to crash. It simply vanished into the grey.

The other two Cleaners now stood in the hatchway. They did not react to their companion’s fall. They assessed the ledge, the wind, the targets. One of them raised its rod, not towards Gregor, but towards the rusted safety cable where Gregor’s hands were clenched.

The hum began, a focused, localized vibration. The cable under Gregor’s palms grew warm, then hot. He felt the vibration travel up his arms, a feeling of dissolution, of the very bonds in the metal straining to come apart.

He let go just as the section of cable he’d been holding sublimated into a puff of orange dust, erased from existence. The gap was now between him and the ladder where Aris and Theo clung.

The wind roared.

The two Cleaners stepped out onto the ledge, their movements unnaturally sure. They began to advance, flanking him.

Gregor looked at the gap. Three feet. Over a thousand-foot drop.

He looked at the Cleaners, closing in, their rods beginning to hum in unison, a chord of erasure.

He heard Aris shout his name, the sound torn away by the gale.

He took two shuffling steps back, felt the edge of the ledge crumble under his heel.

And he jumped.

Chapter 8

A Simple, Physical Calculation
The wind did not roar in his ears. It sighed, a long, tired exhalation of the city, as if disappointed he had chosen to add to its considerable burden of falling things. Gregor’s jump was not a leap of faith, but a simple, physical calculation: certain death by disassembly versus probable death by impact. He preferred the latter. It seemed, in its way, more honest.

He cleared the gap. His chest struck the rungs of the maintenance ladder with a sound like a sack of wet gravel dropped on a tin roof. The air left him in a voiceless wheeze. His fingers, acting on a primal directive his conscious mind had already abandoned, closed around cold, rust-flaked iron. He hung there, a human pendulum, while the universe resolved into two distinct sensations: the burn in his lungs and the distant, insectile hum of the Cleaners’ rods.

“Move!” Aris’s voice was a guttural scrape above him. A hand, small and fierce, clamped around his wrist and pulled. It was Theo. The boy’s face was a pale, determined oval, his teeth bared against the strain. The act of being hauled upward by a child of twelve was so profoundly absurd that it shocked Gregor back into his limbs. He found a rung with his foot, pushed, and scrambled up after them.

They did not stop climbing. The ladder ascended the sheer face of a neighboring spire, a forgotten stitch in the city’s fabric. Below, Gregor glimpsed the two Cleaners standing at the ledge’s edge. They did not attempt the jump. They simply watched, their mirrored visors tilting upward in unison, tracking the climb. Then, as one, they turned and stepped back through the hatch, sealing it behind them. The pursuit was not abandoned; it was being recalibrated. This was, in its way, more frightening.

They climbed for an eternity measured in burning muscles and gust-borne grit. They climbed until the spire’s ornamental peak—a tarnished copper filigree of leaves and gears—offered a precarious sanctuary. They collapsed onto a narrow maintenance platform, a metal grille suspended in the sky, heaving the thin, high-altitude air that tasted of ozone and old rain.

For a long time, the only sounds were their ragged breathing and the low, constant moan of the wind through the filigree. The city sprawled beneath them, a circuit board of grey and sepia, its sorrow-siphons standing sentinel on every other rooftop like sterile mushrooms.

Theo was the first to speak. He uncurled his fist. Nestled in his palm, glowing with a soft, internal bioluminescence like a deep-sea creature, was the thing they had taken from the heart of the Ministry’s archive. The reward. It was not a data-slate or a weapon. It was a seed. Or something shaped like one: an ovate pod of smoky crystal, veined with pulsing amber light. It was warm to the touch, Theo said. It hummed, but not like the Cleaners’ rods. This hum was slower, deeper, a sound felt in the molars and the marrow. A lullaby hum.

“What is it?” Aris asked, her voice hushed. She did not reach for it.

“The counter-melody,” Gregor said, the words coming to him as he said them. He remembered the man from the Ministry, droning about piping wistfulness into creativity hubs. This was the source. Not the siphoned sorrow, but the thing that grew in its absence. The archive had not been storing records; it had been cultivating this. A seed of pure, unfiltered potential. Unburdened ache. It was the opposite of the Cleaners’ erasure. It was an addition. A terrifying one.

Theo looked from the seed to Gregor, his eyes wide. “It’s… it’s showing me things. Not pictures. Feelings. The feeling of a bridge just before you decide to jump. The feeling in a silent house when you know you’re truly alone. The… the good ache in your hand after you’ve finally fixed something broken.” He blinked. “It’s not sad. It’s… full.”

Gregor understood. The seed wasn’t a weapon. It was a lens. And it was already changing the boy, attuning him to frequencies of experience the Ministry had deemed unproductive. It was the ultimate contraband.

Aris took it from Theo’s hand, her movements clinical. She produced a small, lead-lined pouch from an inner pocket—a relic from her time in the Data Morgue—and sealed the seed inside. The glow dimmed, muffled. “It’s a burden, Theo. Not a toy. They’ll unmake the world to get it back.” She fastened the pouch to her belt, her mouth a grim line. The consequence was clear: they were no longer just fugitives. They were carriers.

Their descent was a slow-motion fall through the city’s respiratory system. They used access tunnels that were not tunnels, but gaps between structural membranes. They crossed over on pipes that sweated condensation, under arches that hummed with repressed kinetic energy. The ordinary world—the world of mild, productive melancholy and scheduled discontent—was a thousand vertical feet below. They were in the city’s interstitials, its crawlspaces. And they were not alone.

The Cleaners did not reappear. Instead, the city itself began to turn against them.

It started subtly. A maintenance hatch they had used a hundred times before was suddenly, inexplicably locked, its mechanism fused shut. A stable-looking gantry groaned and listed as Theo’s weight settled on it, forcing a desperate, scrambling detour. The wind, which had been a constant, directionless moan, began to channel down specific conduits, pushing at them, trying to shepherd them towards dead ends or open voids.

“They’ve given us a script,” Aris muttered, bracing against a sudden gust in a vent-shaft. “And we’re not following it. The city’s infrastructure has a protocol for non-compliance. We’re being… edited out.”

Gregor thought of the Cleaner’s rod, turning the cable to dust. This was a larger, slower version of the same principle. The Ministry wasn’t sending hunters; it was adjusting the environment. Making their path impossible. It was the final, most powerful gambit: not a strike, but a deletion of options. The antagonist was the ground beneath their feet, the air in their lungs.

The climax of this silent, architectural siege came at the River Sigh.

The river was not water, but a wide, deep canal of pressurized steam and chemical runoff that bisected the industrial quarter. It was crossed by the Babbage Bridge, a towering latticework of iron and despair, where the city’s officially-sanctioned suicides were performed every third Thursday. The bridge was the only way across for a mile in either direction.

As they emerged onto its lower pedestrian walkway, they saw that the Cleaners were waiting. Not two. Six. They stood at perfect intervals along the bridge’s span, blocking the way forward and the way back. Their rods were inactive, held at their sides. They were a cordon. A fact.

Behind them, with a deep hydraulic sigh, the massive access grilles at both ends of the walkway began to descend. They were being sealed into a killing box.

“The seed,” Aris said, her hand going to the pouch. “It’s the only thing they can’t erase. They have to recover it intact.”

“Which means they won’t use the rods near it,” Gregor finished. He looked at the Cleaners. They would advance. They would use physical force. They would pry the seed from Aris’s cold hands, or from his, or from Theo’s. And then they would be erased.

Theo was staring not at the Cleaners, but at the bridge itself. At the intricate ironwork, the scrolls and gargoyles stained with decades of acidic mist. His eyes had the distant, focused look they got when he was listening to a broken machine. “It’s… sad,” he whispered. “The bridge. It’s so sad.”

The seed’s influence. He was feeling the accumulated sorrow of the place, the weight of all those final, decisive steps.

“Can you use it?” Gregor asked, the idea forming as he spoke. “Not as a shield. As a… a key.”

Theo looked at him, terrified. “I don’t know how.”

“You fixed the music box,” Aris said softly, placing a hand on his shoulder. “You listen. Then you adjust.”

The lead-lined pouch was in Theo’s hands. He opened it. The amber glow spilled out, painting their faces in warm, sickly light. The nearest Cleaners took a synchronized step forward.

Theo closed his eyes. He held the seed against the iron railing of the bridge.

The change was not explosive. It was osmotic. The pulsing amber light seeped into the rust and the pitted metal. It traveled along the rivets and the beams, a swift, capillary wave of resonance. The bridge, a structure designed for one grim, utilitarian purpose, began to remember.

It remembered being ore in the earth. It remembered the fierce, shaping fire of the forge. It remembered the pride of the riveters, the dizzying view from its unfinished apex, the first pigeons that nested in its eaves. It remembered a thousand small, human moments: a stolen kiss in its shadow, a child’s dropped toy rescued from the walkway, the stubborn, lonely vigil of its maintenance workers.

It remembered it was a bridge. A thing of connection.

With a sound like a giant’s harp being tuned, the ironwork shifted. Girders twisted. Walkways reconfigured. The entire central section of the lower span, where they stood, detached from its moorings with a shriek of protesting metal. But it was not a collapse. It was a transformation.

The latticework folded, extended, re-knit itself in mid-air, forming a slender, graceful, impossible arc—a new bridge, shooting out from the main structure like a living branch seeking sunlight. It reached not for the far side of the River Sigh, but for the roof of a low, sprawling archive building on the south bank, a place outside the Cleaners’ cordon, a place of ordinary, dusty safety.

The act of creation was total. The glowing veins in the seed pulsed once, brightly, and then went dark. The crystal turned opaque, grey, and inert. A spent husk. The cost of the bridge’s momentary awakening was its entire store of potential.

Theo slumped, the dead seed falling from his fingers and clattering on the grille. He was pale, hollowed out. The bridge held its new, impossible shape, a monument to a single, beautiful, unsustainable idea.

The Cleaners stood frozen on the original span. Their programming had no response to this. It was not an act of destruction or evasion. It was an act of poetry. Their mirrored visors reflected the new, elegant curve of iron, and in those reflections, it looked for all the world like a question mark.

“Go,” Gregor said, his voice rough.

Aris didn’t hesitate. She hauled Theo to his feet and onto the new, trembling pathway. “Gregor, now!”

He looked at the Cleaners. He looked at the dead seed. He looked at the ordinary world, so close now, just a sprint across a miracle away. The miracle would not last. The bridge was already groaning, its borrowed memory fading. In minutes, it would be so much scrap falling into the steam.

He could follow them. They could make it.

Or he could ensure they did.

The lead-lined pouch lay on the walkway. He picked it up. He placed the inert, grey seed inside. Then, from his own pocket, he took the only thing of beauty he owned: the tiny, moss-green tam o’ shanter with the red bobble, pilfered from a pigeon a lifetime ago. He tucked it gently into the pouch beside the seed. A memory of a different kind of strangeness. A different kind of life.

He sealed the pouch.

“Take this,” he said, tossing it to Aris. She caught it, confusion then dawning horror on her face. “Run. Don’t look back.”

“Gregor, no—”

“The bridge needs a counterweight,” he said, simply. It was a lie, and they all knew it. The bridge needed a distraction. The Cleaners’ protocols would prioritize the recovery of the seed’s container. He was making himself the container.

He turned and walked, not towards the new bridge, but back along the old walkway, towards the advancing Cleaners. He held his empty hands out, palms up. A surrender. A trade.

He heard Aris’s choked sob, the frantic scuff of their boots on iron as they fled across the singing arch. He did not turn.

The Cleaners converged on him. Their grips were cold and absolute. One of them took the lead-lined pouch from his belt. It scanned the contents. The seed was there. The secondary, organic object was irrelevant. Primary objective: secured.

They did not erase him. Not yet. He was witness to the theft. He was data to be debriefed. As they marched him towards the descending grille, towards the waiting, soundless transport, Gregor took one last look over his shoulder.

He saw Aris and Theo reach the far roof. He saw the boy look back, his small figure silhouetted against the grey sky. He saw the beautiful, impossible bridge begin to tremble, then to unravel, its borrowed life spent, falling piece by piece into the hungry steam of the River Sigh.

The access grille sealed behind him with a final, definitive thud.

Inside the transport, a featureless grey capsule, the lead Cleaner held the pouch. With a precise, mechanical motion, it upended it. The dead seed and the tiny woolen hat fell onto a steel examination tray.

The Cleaner’s visor regarded the two objects. One, a vessel of spent potential. The other, a piece of meaningless whimsy.

A protocol flickered, was resolved.

A focused hum filled the capsule. A puff of orange dust, and then grey, settled on the tray.

The erasure was complete.

The transport lifted off, silent as a thought being dismissed, carrying Gregor towards the Ministry, towards the heart of the efficiency that had, at last, perfectly accounted for him.

Chapter 9

Inserted Between the Layers
The transport did not travel through the city so much as it was inserted between its layers, a sterile needle threading the grimy flesh of London. Gregor sat on the featureless bench, his wrists cuffed not with metal, but with a dense, cold field of air that solidified when he tried to move. The Cleaners stood, symmetrical and silent as bookends, their visors reflecting nothing but the capsule’s grey walls. He could feel the vibration of the craft through the bench, a sub-auditory hum that seemed to resonate in the hollow of his teeth. It was the sound of efficient motion. It was the sound of being processed.

He thought of the puff of orange and grey dust. The erasure. It should have felt like a loss, a final, violent pruning. Instead, a peculiar calm settled in him, granular and heavy. They had catalogued the seed and the hat as spent potential and meaningless whimsy. They were correct. And in being correct, they had missed the point entirely. The point had never been the objects. The point had been the hand that placed them together in the same pouch. The point was the story they told in proximity. The Ministry could erase a thing, but could it erase a conjunction? He doubted it. Their entire architecture was built to catalogue nouns, not the fragile prepositions that connected them.

The transport descended. The motion was so smooth it was detected only by a slight pressure change in Gregor’s ears. The door slid open not onto a platform, but directly into a room. A white room. It was not brightly lit, yet it had no shadows. The light seemed to emanate from the very air, leaving no corner, no seam, no place for the eye to rest. It was the visual equivalent of the dial-up modem voice.

The Cleaners guided him out. The cuffs of solidified air dissolved. He was not a prisoner here, the room implied. He was a specimen, already mounted. Escape was not a concept that applied.

“Wait here,” the lead Cleaner said. Its voice was the same as the transport’s hum, given syllables. It turned and left with its unit through a door that appeared, then sealed without a trace. Gregor was alone in the perfect white.

He did not pace. Pacing required a doubt, a searching for options. He stood still. He examined the room. There were no vents, no fixtures, no discernible source of the light or the faint, recycled smell of nothing. After a time—a minute, an hour—he became aware of a sound. It was the faintest possible whisper, a systemic white noise. It was the sound of his own sorrow being measured.

The far wall shimmered, and a man stepped through it as if parting a bead curtain. He was of medium height, medium build, dressed in the standard-issue grey suit of the mid-level Efficiency officer. His face was pleasant, forgettable. He held a tablet that was just a darker grey rectangle against the grey of his suit.

“Gregor,” the man said. His voice was warm. It was the warmest, most reasonable voice Gregor had ever heard. It was the voice of a dial-up modem that had learned to simulate compassion. “Thank you for your patience. The debriefing phase can now commence.”

“Is that what this is?” Gregor asked. His own voice sounded rough, a stray mark on the clean page of the room.

“Clarification is always preferable to ambiguity,” the man said, smiling a smile that was a perfect curve of neutral goodwill. “I am Analyst Kray. You may think of me as a facilitator. Our system has experienced an anomaly. You were proximate to that anomaly. Your perspective will help us recalibrate.”

Kray did not gesture to a chair, because there were none. He simply stood, comfortable in the perpetual standing-room of official thought. “Let’s begin with the secondary organic object. The… avian garment.”

“The hat,” Gregor said.

“The hat,” Kray agreed, making a note on his tablet. “Its presence in a secure containment pouch is a non-sequitur. Non-sequiturs are informational static. They degrade signal integrity. Help me understand the sequence.”

Gregor looked at the white wall behind Kray. He imagined a tiny, moss-green smudge there. “The pigeon was cold,” he said.

Kray’s stylus paused. He looked up. The pleasant expression did not change, but the temperature behind his eyes seemed to drop a degree. “Elaborate.”

“It was winter. The window ledge was iced. The hat was wool. It was a gesture of… thermal management.” Gregor heard the words leave his mouth, flat and bureaucratic. He was speaking their language. It was surprisingly easy.

“Thermal management,” Kray repeated, typing. “An act of inefficient charity. Directed towards a non-productive, disease-vector species.”

“It was knitting practice,” Gregor said. “The wool was leftover. The action filled an otherwise idle moment. The satisfaction of completing a minor task provided a dopamine stimulus that increased my subsequent focus on Ministry bulletins by an estimated twelve percent.”

Kray’s head tilted. The analysis was being processed. A flicker of something—not suspicion, but a recalculation—passed over his face. “You are applying a productivity framework to a whimsical action.”

“I am contextualizing it,” Gregor corrected softly. “You catalogue the wistful, low-grade stuff. The ‘rainy Tuesday’ grade of ache. Was it not a kind of civic sorrow? The ache of wasted yarn? The melancholy of a cold pigeon? I was simply… pre-processing it. Before your siphons could be installed.”

The room seemed to listen. The white noise hum adjusted its pitch almost imperceptibly.

Kray’s smile returned, firmer now. “You are attempting to gamify the system. To justify a non-compliant sentiment through retroactive optimization logic.” He sounded almost admiring. “It’s a known cognitive distortion. Sentiment’s last stand. We have a department for that.”

“I’m sure you do,” Gregor said.

“Let us move to the primary object,” Kray said, swiping his screen. “The seed. A Class-3 Bio-Anomaly, designation ‘Waking Heart.’ Capable of temporary, unstable psio-organic transduction. You used it to create an unauthorized structure. A bridge.”

“The bridge was necessary. The new municipal bridge was non-operational.”

“It was undergoing scheduled sentiment-hardening. Its melancholy infusion was at seventy-eight percent. Completion was imminent. Your action diverted resources, caused a public spectacle, and resulted in the total loss of the anomaly.” Kray looked at him, the warm voice now gently chiding. “You traded a permanent, regulated municipal asset for a temporary, chaotic one. You traded a calibrated, productive sorrow for a moment of… what? Heroic feeling? It’s the same equation as the hat. Inefficiency romanticized.”

Gregor said nothing. He was listening to the space between Kray’s words. He heard the unspoken text: We have accounted for your rebellion. We have a category for it. It is a sub-clause of inefficiency.

“You allowed the children to escape,” Kray continued. “You submitted to detention. A calculated trade. You believed the seed’s container—your person—would be of secondary interest to its recovery.” He leaned forward, a confidential tilt. “It was a noble error. The Cleaners’ primary protocol was recovery of the anomaly. Your secondary status was confirmed. You are not a container, Gregor. You are a witness. And now, you are data.”

The wall to Gregor’s left shimmered. An image resolved, crisp and silent: Aris and Theo, seen from a high angle, moving through the rooftop forest of chimney pots and satellite dishes near the old railway yard. Theo was clutching his side, limping. Aris had an arm around him, head swiveling, looking for a path down. The image was live.

“The anomaly is gone,” Kray said, watching Gregor watch the screen. “But the instability it provoked persists. These two are now vectors of chaotic narrative. They have experienced an unsanctioned miracle. They will talk. They will feel. That feeling will propagate. It is a psychosocial contaminant.”

On screen, Aris pulled Theo into the shadow of a large water tank. Their faces were pale smudges of fear and exhaustion.

“The standard treatment is cleansing,” Kray said, his voice a gentle, regretful sigh. “Neutralization of the vectors. A return to baseline. It’s very quick. But it’s also… final. A waste of potential biomass.”

Gregor’s heart was a cold, hard knot in his chest. He kept his eyes on the screen. “You have an alternative.”

“We have an optimization,” Kray corrected. He gestured, and the image of Aris and Theo froze, enlarged. A targeting reticule appeared, hovering over them, then gently faded. “You demonstrated a capacity for predictive modeling. You anticipated Cleaner protocols. Your initial analysis of the hat, while flawed, showed an attempt to integrate sentiment into a functional framework. You are a flawed system, Gregor, but you are a system. One that understands the old, messy world from the inside.”

Kray let the words hang in the sterile air. The white noise hummed its agreement.

“The Ministry is rolling out the civic sorrow-siphons next week. The public requires… acclimatization. A guide who speaks both languages. The language of rainy Tuesdays, and the language of calibrated melancholy.” Kray’s smile was benevolent. “You could be that guide. A Conduit, Grade-2. You would help people understand. You would translate their unruly grief into the mild, productive sort. You would find the Aris and Theo vectors before they destabilize, and you would help them… transition. To be useful.”

Gregor looked from the frozen, vulnerable image on the wall to Kray’s reasonable face. This was the final battle, and it was here, in this room that was not a room. The antagonist was not a snarling monster, but a purified, perfect version of his own flaw: the part of him that had always sought to manage, to explain, to knit a sensible hat for a chaotic world. The Ministry was offering him the ultimate tam o’ shanter, one big enough to cover the entire city, to make its shivering, pointless beauty seem like a necessary part of a larger, efficient thermal plan.

“And if I refuse?” Gregor asked, though he already knew.

Kray’s smile didn’t waver. He gestured again to the screen. The targeting reticule reappeared, solid and red. “Then the cleansing proceeds. The instability is excised. And you, as the source-witness, will be re-categorized. From data point to contaminant. And contaminants are erased.”

He said it with the same tone he might use to describe a routine filing. It was not a threat. It was a schedule.

Gregor closed his eyes. He did not think of Aris and Theo, not directly. He thought of the feel of the seed in his hand, not as power, but as a conjunction. A ‘and’. He thought of the bridge, not as a structure, but as a verb. He thought of the hat, not as whimsy, but as a question posed in wool. What if you are not alone?

He had learned that efficiency that erased questions was not efficiency at all. It was death. The real melancholy was not in the rainy Tuesday, but in the belief that the Tuesday must be made to mean something, to be productive. The real ache was in the refusal of the ache.

He opened his eyes. He looked at Kray, at the pleasant, empty face waiting for the logical, self-preserving answer.

“No,” Gregor said.

It was not a shout. It was a simple statement, a flat stone dropped into the pond of the white room. It created ripples in the air.

Kray blinked. The smile remained, but it was now an artifact, a painted-on curve. “Clarify.”

“I will not be your Conduit. I will not translate.” Gregor took a step forward. The white light felt thick, resistant. “You want to siphon sorrow? Start with mine. It’s right here. It’s the grade of ache you’ll never calibrate. It’s the ache for a world where a pigeon can wear a stupid hat for no reason at all. It’s the ache for a bridge that sings itself to pieces. It’s unproductive. It’s wasteful. It’s mine.”

Kray’s tablet dimmed. His head cocked, the analysis hitting a recursive loop. “This is non-compliance. This is sentiment asserting itself as principle. It is illogical.”

“It’s the only logic left,” Gregor said. And he laughed. The sound was shocking in the white room, a ragged, unpracticed thing. It was the sound of a system error that refused to be debugged.

Kray took a step back. The movement was small, but in that room, it was a seismic shift. He was not prepared for laughter. The Ministry had protocols for anger, for grief, for fear. It had a department for gamified sentiment. It had no category for this specific, undiluted joy of refusal.

The white noise in the room spiked, becoming a sharp, painful ring. The walls seemed to pulse.

“Contaminant status confirmed,” Kray said, his warm voice finally gaining a texture: a brittle, metallic edge. “Cleansing protocol initiated.”

On the screen, the targeting reticule glowed bright. A Cleaner unit, sleek and black against the grimy bricks, emerged onto the rooftop, moving with silent intent towards the water tank.

Gregor stopped laughing. He looked at the screen, at the children about to be made into a lesson in efficiency. He had no seed. No bridge. No tools but the one they had given him: his own categorized, analyzed self.

He understood the test now. The final test. It was not to defeat the Ministry with a greater power. It was to defeat it by being, utterly and completely, what it could not digest. Not a hero. Not a rebel. A non-sequitur.

He turned from the screen, away from the unfolding tragedy, and looked Kray directly in the eye.

“The hat wasn’t knitting practice,” Gregor said, his voice calm, clear. “And it wasn’t thermal management. I made it because my daughter, Elara, taught me how to knit. She made the bobble. She’s been gone for five years. The pigeon reminded me of the way she’d tilt her head when she was concentrating. It was a memorial. It was a love letter to a dead child, worn by a bird that doesn’t know its own name.”

He spoke each word with a devastating clarity. He offered it up. Not as data. As a story. A story with a hole in its heart where the love had been.

Kray stared. His mouth opened slightly. The tablet in his hand emitted a soft, confused chime. He was trying to process. He was trying to file love letter to a dead child under a header. He was trying to calculate the productive melancholy yield of such a statement. The system was searching for a correlative, a precedent. It found none.

The white noise stuttered, cracked into a burst of static.

On the screen, the advancing Cleaner halted. Its visor tilted, a gesture of query. It was receiving conflicting data streams.

“You can erase the hat,” Gregor continued, taking another step towards Kray, who took another step back. “You can erase the seed. You can erase me. But you cannot erase the ‘because.’ You cannot erase the ‘for.’ She taught me. Because I loved her. The hat was for the pigeon, for the memory. Your siphons can only collect the fog. You miss the weather.”

Kray’s back touched the wall. It did not yield. He was trapped against the perfect, white surface of his own worldview. “You are… introducing narrative variables,” he stammered. “This is a debriefing, not a… a storytelling.”

“Everything is a story,” Gregor said. He was close now. He could see the fine pores on Kray’s skin, the faint tremor in his placid eyelid. “Your efficiency report is a story where the hero is a percentage point. My story has a pigeon in a hat. Mine is better.”

He reached out, not to strike Kray, but to tap the man’s grey-suited chest, right over the heart. “The ache you want to pipe into your creativity hubs? This is where it comes from. And you can’t have it. It’s not yours to manage.”

A high-pitched alarm sounded, not in the room, but seemingly in the fabric of the building itself. The white light flickered, strobing. On the screen, the Cleaner unit was retreating, stepping back into the shadows, its protocol scrambled by the unresolved, non-compliant data surge from the interrogation room.

Kray looked frantically from Gregor to his tablet, which was now flashing a rapid sequence of error codes: NARRATIVE INTRUSION. PARADOX DETECTED. CONTAINMENT FAILURE.

“What have you done?” Kray whispered, his voice stripped of all its modulated warmth, revealing the bare, frightened wire beneath.

“I told the truth,” Gregor said. “It’s a glitch in your system. It always has been.”

The door—the real, solid door that led back to the transport bay—hissed open. Cold, unfiltered air from the Ministry’s utility ducts washed into the room, smelling of ozone and dust. The perfect white environment was breached.

Gregor didn’t run. He walked. He walked past the paralyzed Kray, out of the room, into the grey, grimy, beautiful complexity of the corridor. Alarms warbled, but they sounded confused, unsure of the nature of the emergency. Was it a security breach? A systems failure? A philosophical crisis?

He followed the draft, the smell of the outside world leaking in. He found a service lift, its gate scuffed and manual. He pulled it open, stepped inside, and began to crank the lever, descending not into the bowels of the Ministry, but towards the street level, towards the chaotic, inefficient, rainy Tuesday of a world.

His resurrection was not a dramatic bursting forth. It was a slow, grinding descent on rusty gears. He was not reborn powerful. He was reborn irrelevant. A man the system had tried to digest and had, instead, spat back out. A man who carried within him a story it could not process. He was a walking non-sequitur. He was free.

He emerged into a back alley, slick with real rain. The air was thick with the smell of wet pavement and fried food. It was glorious. He looked up. Somewhere above, in a white room, Analyst Kray was trying to file a report on what had just happened. Gregor hoped it gave him a headache.

He had no plan. He was a contaminant. He would have to move. But first, he had to find a story’s ending.

He moved through the city, a grey man in the grey rain, but he felt lit from within by a strange, quiet fire. He navigated by memory and instinct, towards the railway yards, towards the last place he had seen a story besides his own.

It took hours. He saw no Cleaners. The Ministry’s attention seemed turned inward, dealing with its own sudden, systemic indigestion.

He found them in the lee of a crumbling brick archway, part of an old viaduct. A small, hidden space, littered with broken pottery and wild, defiant weeds. Aris was tending to Theo’s injured side, using a strip of their own shirt as a bandage. They both looked up as his shadow fell across them. Their faces were hollow with exhaustion, but their eyes were alive, watchful.

For a long moment, no one spoke. The rain dripped from the archway.

“They said you were erased,” Aris finally said, their voice raw.

“They were wrong,” Gregor said. He crouched down, his knees protesting. He looked at Theo’s pale face. “How’s the side?”

“Bruised,” Theo managed. “Not broken. You… you came back.”

“I had to finish the story,” Gregor said.

Aris searched his face. “What story?”

“Ours,” he said. He reached into his pocket. He had nothing left. No seed. No hat. But his fingers brushed against a single, dried pea that had been in his coat for weeks, a remnant of some forgotten lunch. He pulled it out. It was wrinkled, unremarkable.

He placed it on the damp earth between them.

“It’s not a seed,” he said. “It’s just a pea. But it’s here. And we’re here.” He looked at Aris, then at Theo. “The Ministry believes a story needs a point. A function. It doesn’t. It just needs to be told. And it needs someone to listen.”

He sat back against the cold brick. The fatigue washed over him, total and complete. He had nothing left to give. He had given it all in the white room.

Aris looked at the pea. A slow, tentative smile touched their grimy face. They reached out and covered the pea with a cupped hand, not taking it, but protecting it from the rain.

“So,” Aris said. “What happens now?”

Gregor closed his eyes, listening to the rain, to the distant, inefficient rumble of the city. He was a man who had faced the heart of the machine and told it a story about a hat. He was a man who had traded his own logic for a deeper, stranger truth. He was permanently, irrevocably changed.

He opened his eyes. Across the city, the first of the new civic sorrow-siphons was being unveiled on the roof of the South-Western Creativity Hub. A ceremony was underway. Speeches were being made about calibrated melancholy and productive wistfulness.

Gregor looked at the two children, the vectors of chaotic narrative, waiting for his answer.

“Now,” he said, his voice a low rumble in the gathering dark, “we become a glitch in the system.”

Chapter 10

A Sound Like a Broken Clock
The rain stopped just before dawn, not with a decision, but with a gradual forgetting. The clouds thinned into a pale, indifferent grey. Water dripped from the rusted fire escape with a sound like a broken clock trying to remember its purpose.

Gregor’s knees had fused into a single, aching unit. He unfolded himself from the damp brick, the movement a series of geological events. Aris was asleep, curled around the spot where the pea lay buried under a handful of patted earth. Theo watched him, eyes too bright in a face the colour of old paper.

“We can’t stay here,” Gregor said. His voice was gravel shifting in a tin.

Theo nodded, winced. “Where?”

Gregor looked up. The alley was a cleft of shadow, but above, the sky was lightening into the city’s default setting: a non-committal off-white, like the ceiling of a waiting room. Somewhere, a sorrow-siphon was being fine-tuned. He could feel it in his teeth, a sub-auditory hum that was the exact frequency of a forgotten appointment.

“Somewhere they won’t look,” Gregor said. “Somewhere inefficient.”

The place was a bakery. Or it had been. The sign over the door read “The Daily Loaf” in cheerful, cursive script that was now blistered and sad. The windows were boarded, but the back door, down a service lane choked with the ghosts of flour sacks, hung open on one hinge. It smelled of yeast gone to war, of sugar turned feral.

Inside, it was a cathedral of quiet ruin. Ovens gaped like dark mouths. A single, long wooden table, scarred by decades of kneading, dominated the centre of the room. Dust motes swam in the thin light from a high, grimy window. It was perfect.

Aris, upon waking in the new space, had immediately begun exploring the corners, their fingers tracing the outlines of forgotten tools. Theo sat on the table’s edge, legs dangling, trying not to breathe too deeply.

Gregor stood in the middle of the floor. He was a man assembled from spare parts found in a dark drawer. The logic that had once held him together—the cause-and-effect, the procedural certainty—had been dissolved in the white room. What remained was a narrative cohesion, a sense of sequence that felt more like remembering the future than planning it. He was a story that had learned to tell itself.

“They’ll be looking for a man and two children,” he said, more to the room than to them. “They won’t be looking for a baker.”

Aris emerged from behind an oven, holding a fossilized lump of dough. “You don’t know how to bake.”

“I know how to follow a process,” Gregor said. “And I know how things are supposed to rise.” He looked at the dead ovens. “Metaphorically.”

The first task was the door. Gregor wrestled it back onto its hinges, a silent, straining ballet. He used a broken rolling pin as a makeshift bar. It wouldn’t stop a determined search, but it would make a satisfying, inefficient racket if opened. A warning.

Theo, moving stiffly, began sweeping the floor with a broom missing most of its bristles. It was less about cleaning and more about making patterns in the dust—concentric circles, like ripples from a dropped stone. Aris, meanwhile, had found a stash of tiny, desiccated icing flowers in a cupboard and was arranging them in a line along the windowsill, a procession of edible ghosts.

Gregor watched them. The Ministry would see two traumatized assets in need of recalibration. He saw two engines of glorious, inconvenient plot. Theo, the reader, seeking order in the chaos. Aris, the author, imposing chaos onto order. And himself? He was the page they were written on. Permanently altered.

He felt a vibration through the soles of his boots. Deep, rhythmic. Not machinery. Footsteps. Many of them.

He held up a hand. Theo froze, the broom whispering to a halt. Aris palmed their icing flowers and melted into the shadow of a flour bin.

The footsteps weren’t approaching. They were passing. A steady, synchronized tramp. Gregor went to the high window, dragged a sack of petrified something-or-other beneath it, and climbed. He peered through a clear patch in the grime.

On the street outside, a procession was underway. It was a parade, but a Ministry parade, which meant it had all the joy of a tax audit. A phalanx of Efficiency Officers in dove-grey uniforms marched in perfect, dreary lockstep. Behind them, on a flatbed truck pulled by a silent electric vehicle, stood the first civic sorrow-siphon.

It was not what he’d expected. It wasn’t a grim, industrial pump. It was beautiful. A slender column of polished brass and smoked glass, about ten feet tall, crowned with a delicate, rotating filigree that caught the flat light and spun it into dull rainbows. It looked like an art deco antenna for listening to the sighs of angels. A small placard on the truck read: Prototype Theta: Harvesting the Productive Hum of Human Wistfulness.

Behind the siphon walked the man from the Ministry, the one with the dial-up modem voice. He was speaking into a hovering mic-droid, his words amplified into the sterile street.

“...not an extraction of joy, as some sentimentalists have claimed. That would be counter-productive. Joy has its place—in designated leisure zones, at approved intervals. This is a refinement. A harvesting of the low-grade psychic sediment that otherwise clogs the cognitive gears. The ‘Sunday evening’ feeling. The ‘lost glove’ feeling. We are not thieves. We are gardeners. Pruning the existential hedge for the health of the whole.”

The crowd—a thin, politely assembled line of citizens—applauded with a sound like falling gravel. Their faces were smooth, attentive, and utterly vacant. They had been pre-calibrated.

Gregor’s eyes were drawn not to the siphon, but to its base. Where it connected to the truck’s power grid, he saw a familiar, sleek black cable. It was identical to the one that had fed the logic-scrubber in the white room. The same technology. Repurposed.

The procession turned a corner and was gone, the hum of the electric truck fading into the city’s background noise. The street was empty again.

Gregor stepped down from the sack. His heart was a slow, cold drum.

“What was it?” Theo whispered.

“The new weather,” Gregor said.
  - They stayed in the bakery for three days. The world outside continued its efficient turn. The news-feeds, which Gregor accessed by cautiously tapping into a public terminal’s ghost signal (the previous user had been researching the migratory patterns of urban sparrows—a delightfully pointless query), were full of the siphon’s unveiling. It was a triumph of applied emotional architecture. Early readings from the South-Western Creativity Hub showed a seventeen percent increase in output from the lyric poets and a thirty-two percent increase from the designers of administrative forms. The wistfulness was being converted into something useful. The weather in the Hub was reported as “a consistent, inspiring drizzle of the soul.”

There was no mention of a missing Logic-Scriber. No bulletins about fugitive narrative contaminants. The Ministry had erased his departure as neatly as they had tried to erase him. He was a nullity. A blank space. It was, he realized, the perfect camouflage.

On the fourth day, the problem of food became urgent. The pea was buried under the bakery table, a shrine to potential. It would not fill stomachs.

“I’ll go,” Gregor said.

“They’ll see you,” Theo said.

“They see a man in a worn coat. A ghost. Ghosts are beneath notice.” He looked at Aris. “Keep the door barred. Don’t answer for anyone.”

The city felt different. Not transformed, but tuned. The air had a crisp, clarified quality, as if a layer of psychic static had been scrubbed away. People walked with a direct, uncluttered purpose. No one gazed wistfully at a cloud. No one paused to watch a scrap of newspaper chase itself in a gutter-eddy. The low-grade melancholy, the background hum of tiny human aches, was gone. It had been the city’s patina, its fingerprint of smudged hopes. Now it was just… clean. Sterile.

Gregor felt its absence like a missing tooth. His own internal landscape, once a flat plain of procedure, was now a tangled, overgrown garden of feeling. The contrast was violent. He was a riot of colour in a world rendered in efficient grey-scale.

He bought stale bread, a wedge of hard cheese, a bottle of water. Simple, untraceable transactions. The shopkeeper didn’t meet his eyes, just scanned the items and stated the price in a voice devoid of inflection. As Gregor left, he saw a small, brass outlet newly installed in the wall behind the counter. A subtle logo beside it: a teardrop falling into a cog. The sorrow-siphon grid was already being rolled out. Plug in and drain the ache.

He was two blocks from the bakery when he saw the pigeon.

It was on the ledge of a bank, pecking at nothing. It was the same pigeon. Or it was a different pigeon wearing the same tam o’ shanter. The moss-green wool, the jaunty red bobble. It was slightly askew now, as if the pigeon had been in a minor scuffle. It turned its head, one beady eye fixing on Gregor.

Then it took off, flying not up into the sky, but down the street, just above head height, weaving between pedestrians.

Gregor followed.

It was not a pursuit. It was an invitation. The pigeon flew at a steady, followable pace, landing every hundred yards or so to preen under its tiny hat, waiting for him to catch up. It led him away from the commercial grids, into the older, crumbling arteries of the city where the buildings leaned together like gossips and the pavement was buckled by ancient tree roots.

The pigeon finally landed on the rusted railing of a bridge that spanned a concrete canal. A trickle of oily water moved sluggishly below. On the other side of the bridge was a park. Or what had once been a park. It was now a wild, untamed knot of green, a forgotten square where the landscaping algorithms had failed and no one had bothered to reset them. Weeds grew in glorious, chaotic sprays. A willow tree wept into the stagnant canal. In the centre was a bandstand, its paint peeling, its roof a home for birds.

Sitting on the bandstand steps, feeding seeds to a small congregation of unremarkable pigeons, was the old woman from the archives. The Keeper of Unnecessary Facts.

She wore a coat that might have been made from several different carpets. Her hair was a nest of white. She did not look up as Gregor approached, but she patted the space on the step beside her.

“The hat suited him,” she said, scattering a handful of seeds. “Gives him a certain dignity. Don’t you think?”

Gregor sat. The iron step was cold. “You’re not surprised to see me.”

“I’m surprised you’re still in one piece. The stories that go into the white room usually come out as pulp.” She glanced at him, her eyes bright as a bird’s. “But you. You fed the machine a story it couldn’t digest. You gave it a hat. I like that.”

“They’re siphoning the sorrow,” Gregor said. The words felt too small for the thing they described.

“Of course they are,” she said, as if he’d remarked on rain. “It was always the next step. First they tidy the facts. Then they tidy the feelings. Can’t have unchecked melancholy floating about. It leads to… art. To sitting on bridges. To wondering.” She offered him the bag of seeds. He took a handful. The pigeons cooed and bobbed. “They’ve left you alone, haven’t they? Since you came out.”

“Yes.”

“Because you’re a paradox. A Logic-Scriber who operates on narrative rules. You broke their system so completely you fell out of its classification matrix. You’re a zero. A null. You’re free.”

It didn’t feel like freedom. It felt like exile.

“The children,” he said.

“Ah, yes. The vectors.” She smiled, a network of fine lines spreading from her eyes. “They’ll be looking for them. The boy is a reader. A terrible, dangerous thing to be. The girl is a maker of messes. Even more dangerous. They represent unregulated input and uncontrollable output. The Ministry’s two worst nightmares.”

“What do I do?”

“You’ve already done it. You’re telling their story. You’re providing the context. Without you, they’re just anomalies. With you, they’re a… what’s the word?” She tapped her chin. “A narrative. A glitch in the system, as you so poetically put it.”

Gregor looked out at the wild park. It was gloriously, rebelliously inefficient. A pocket of chaos. “They can’t live in a bakery forever.”

“No,” she agreed. She reached into her carpet-coat and pulled out a small, cloth-wrapped bundle. She handed it to him. “They need a library.”

He unwrapped it. Inside was a key. Old, iron, heavy. It was tied with a tag that read, in spidery cursive: St. Florian’s.

“It’s a place?” he asked.

“It’s a story,” she corrected. “A place where stories go to hide. It’s where I send the facts too beautiful to be necessary. It’s damp. It has mice. The children will love it.”

He closed his fist around the key. It was solid. Real. A plot point. “Why are you helping?”

She stood up, brushing seeds from her lap. The pigeons scattered, then settled again. The tam o’ shanter pigeon landed on her shoulder.

“Because, Gregor,” she said, “someone has to keep the useless things alive. The hats. The peas. The rainy Tuesdays. Otherwise, what’s the point of all their dreadful efficiency?” She began to walk away, then paused. “The siphon. It’s beautiful, isn’t it?”

“It is.”

“The most dangerous lies always are. It doesn’t just take the sorrow, you know. It replaces it. A faint, constant signal. A hum of approved contentment. It’s not just gardening. It’s reprogramming.”

She disappeared into the wild green of the park, becoming just another splash of unpredictable colour.
  - The bakery felt different when he returned. Not just because of the food. Because he had a destination.

He told them about the park, about the Keeper. He showed them the key. Aris held it, their face solemn. “St. Florian’s,” they read.

“It’s a library for things no one needs to know,” Gregor said.

Theo’s eyes lit with a frail hope. “Like what?”

“Like the average number of times a person sighs in a lifetime. Like the recipe for a cake that was only ever baked once, in 1843, for a dog’s birthday. Like the musical notation for the sound of a falling leaf hitting a pond.”

Aris grinned. It was the first real, uncomplicated grin Gregor had seen from them. “That’s the best kind of library.”

They left the bakery as they had found it, but Aris scraped the icing flowers from the sill and pocketed them. Theo carefully smoothed over the dust-ripples he had made with the broom. Gregor left the petrified lump of dough on the table, a monument to their temporary, fragile rising.

The journey was a lesson in stealth. They moved through the city’s forgotten spaces: service tunnels that smelled of damp and ozone, the narrow gaps between buildings where moss grew, the rooftops that formed a ragged, uneven landscape above the ordered streets. Gregor led, his new narrative sense guiding him like a dowser’s rod towards the path of least plot, the route of maximum obscurity.

They saw the city from above. They saw the sorrow-siphons. They were being installed on rooftops across the district, those beautiful brass-and-glass spines, turning slowly in the breeze like sunflowers seeking not light, but sighing. The air grew thinner, clearer, more vacant.

St. Florian’s was not a church. It had been, once. A tiny, soot-blackened stone building wedged between two towering administrative blocks, like a childhood memory stuck between two heavy, important books. The stained-glass windows were boarded. The oak door, studded with iron, looked impenetrable.

Gregor fit the key into the lock. It turned with a sound that was not a click, but a deep, satisfying thunk, like a book being closed after a very good ending.

The smell that wafted out was complex and ancient: damp paper, leather bindings, coal dust, and the faint, sweet trace of long-ago incense. They stepped inside.

It was not a library in the Ministry sense. There were no rows of identical shelves, no categorization terminals. It was a chaos of knowledge. Books were stacked in teetering pillars. Scrolls spilled from barrels. Glass jars lined shelves, containing things like “The Dream of a Clerk, Tuesday Last” (a tiny, silver fog) and “The Echo of a Slamming Door in an Empty House” (a faint, brown vibration). Maps were pinned to every wall, not of geography, but of things like “The Emotional Weather of this Street, 1892-1894” and “Documented Cases of Spontaneous Joy, Grid Reference G7.”

Aris let out a breath of pure delight. Theo walked slowly to the nearest stack, his fingers hovering over the spine of a book titled An Unnecessarily Detailed Taxonomy of Cracks in Pavement.

“It’s perfect,” Theo whispered.

A high, narrow window, its board loose, let in a blade of afternoon light. It illuminated the motes of dust, which here did not just float, but seemed to dance in slow, complex patterns, as if remembering old waltzes.

They had a home. A hideout made of stories.
  - The days began to form a new pattern, a rhythm as old and deep as a heartbeat.

Gregor became the caretaker of useless things. He learned the library’s whims. The section on “Lost Hats” required a weekly reading from a book of Victorian poetry, or the descriptions would fade. The jar labelled “The Scent of a Memory of Rain” needed to be near the leak in the roof to stay potent.

Theo devoured. He read about the philosophy of cobwebs, the etiquette of ghosts, the migratory patterns of rumours. Colour returned to his cheeks, not just from healing, but from a kind of intellectual fervour. He began to make notes in a blank book the Keeper had left for him, cross-referencing things. He was mapping the chaos.

Aris created. They built small, intricate dioramas in empty corners: the bakery from a mouse’s perspective, the white room made of icing flowers and bitterness, the park with the bandstand, using twigs and threads. They were silent, concentrated acts of rebuilding the world on their own terms.

Gregor watched them. This was the ‘elixir’. Not a thing, but a process. Not a fixed point, but a way of moving through the world. He had brought them here, to a place where their specific magic was not a glitch, but the point. He had fixed the initial problem—their pursuit, their danger—not by defeating the Ministry, but by hiding them in plain sight, inside a story too bizarre for the Ministry’s logic to comprehend.

Sometimes, at night, they would sit on the floor by the light of a single, fat candle (the electricity, the Keeper had noted, was “too predictable”). Gregor would tell them stories. Not Ministry-sanctioned parables with clear morals. But strange, meandering tales. The story of the man who tried to catalogue his own sighs. The story of the streetlamp that fell in love with the moon.

One evening, as he finished a story about a key that could open anything except the door it was made for, Theo looked up from his notebook.

“They’re still out there,” he said quietly. “The siphons. They’re everywhere now. Mrs. Enderby at the corner shop said she hasn’t felt ‘properly blue’ in weeks. She said she misses it.”

Aris, who was stitching a tiny, felt tam o’ shanter for a beetle they’d befriended, nodded. “It’s too quiet. Inside.”

Gregor knew what they meant. The constant, low-grade hum of the city’s soul was gone. In its place was a silent, efficient hum of machinery. The emotional weather was now centrally controlled. A permanent, gentle overcast.

“We’re safe here,” Gregor said. It was true. But it was a small truth, in a small, story-filled room.

“For how long?” Aris asked, not looking up from their stitching. “Stories need to be told. To someone. Or they fade.”

She was right. A library, unattended, is just a tomb. A story untold is just ink on paper.

The hook was in him then. Not a sudden jerk, but a slow, inevitable pull. He had saved them. He had brought the elixir home. But the Ordinary World was no longer ordinary. It had been technologically sanitized. The wound he had fixed for them was healed, but the body was now sick in a new, pervasive way.

He was a glitch. But a glitch in an isolated system is just a minor error. A glitch that begins to replicate, to spread its strange code…
  - The goodbye, when it came, was not with the Keeper. She visited sometimes, bringing strange gifts—a vial of “November Light, circa 1920,” a book of poems written by a computer that had a nervous breakdown. Their alliance was a given, a thread that needed no tying off.

The goodbye was with the children. With the new, balanced world they had forged in the heart of the forgotten library.

It was a Tuesday. A rainy Tuesday. Or it should have been. The sky was the usual flat white, and the precipitation was a fine, targeted mist from the municipal weather array, calibrated for optimal plant growth and pedestrian transit. No wistfulness. No ache.

Gregor stood at the heavy oak door. He wore his old coat. In the pocket was the felt tam o’ shanter Aris had made for him, a perfect, tiny replica. In his other pocket was a single, dried pea.

Theo had given him the notebook. “It’s a copy,” Theo said, his voice tight. “Of the important things. The connections. In case… you need to remember how things fit.”

Aris had not given him anything. They had just looked at him, their eyes older than the library. “You have to go and be a glitch somewhere else,” they said. It wasn’t a question.

“The system is bigger than this district,” Gregor said. “The siphons are spreading. The story… our story… it needs more listeners.”

He crouched, his knees complaining in the old, familiar way. He looked at them, these two vectors who had remade him. “This is your place now. Keep the useless things alive. Read the unnecessary facts. Make the messy, beautiful things. That is how you fight. Not with weapons. With wonder.”

He saw the understanding in Theo’s eyes, the fierce, creative spark in Aris’s. They were not just safe. They were armed. They were a library and a factory of beautiful resistance.

He stood. He did not hug them. It was not that kind of story. He simply nodded, turned, and opened the heavy door.

The city sound rushed in—the hum of the sorrow-siphons, the whisper of targeted rain, the low thrum of efficient transport. It was the sound of a world being perfected into oblivion.

He stepped out into it. He did not look back. He walked away from St. Florian’s, from the sanctuary of stories, and into the wide, sterile street.

He was a man permanently changed. A Logic-Scriber who now thought in metaphors. A nullity who was now a narrative. He had faced the heart of the machine and told it a story about a hat. He had saved two children by hiding them in a cathedral of irrelevance.

But a story, once begun, demands an ending. Or a continuation.

He walked towards the central spire of the Ministry of Efficiency, a needle of polished steel threading the white sky. He didn’t walk with purpose—that would be too efficient, too noticeable. He walked with the meandering, curious pace of a man observing details: the way the siphons’ rainbows cast no shadows, the way people’s smiles were all the same width.

He was going to report for duty.

The idea had come to him in the library, watching Theo cross-reference the sigh of a clerk with the migration of rumours. The Ministry believed he was erased. A null. A zero. They had no classification for him. He was invisible to their systems.

But they would have a classification for a man who walked in the front door. A man in a worn coat, claiming to be a Logic-Scriber, reporting a minor anomaly he’d observed. A glitch in the emotional weather data. A tiny, localized resurgence of unregulated wistfulness near the old canal park.

He would be processed. He would be assessed. He would be inserted into the very system that had tried to delete him.

He would be a story, walking into the machine. Not to break it from the outside. To become a virus in its code. To tell it, from the inside, a new kind of story. One about hats, and peas, and rainy Tuesdays that belonged to no one.

He reached the vast, polished plaza before the Ministry spire. His reflection, long and distorted, wavered on the rain-slicked stone. He adjusted the tiny, felt hat in his pocket.

He climbed the steps, a single, shabby figure against the tide of grey uniforms flowing in and out. The doors hissed open, swallowing the efficient ones.

Gregor took a final breath of the thin, siphon-scrubbed air.

Then he crossed the threshold, back into the heart of the machine, to begin the final, most dangerous chapter. Not as a prisoner. Not as a fugitive.

As a trojan horse made of story.

Chapter 11

The Scent of a Ghost
The municipal sorrow-siphons, for a period of exactly seventeen days, developed a curious and persistent fault. They began to emit, instead of the calibrated baseline of mild, productive melancholy, a scent. It was not a smell that could be catalogued by the Ministry’s olfactory arrays—it was too vague, too personal. Some citizens reported the ghost of old books left in an attic; others, the particular damp wool of a school blazer on the first day of autumn; a few, the faint, sugared trace of a cake that never quite turned out as the recipe promised. It was the aroma of a memory that hadn’t happened, a collective, unregulated wistfulness that hung in the air like dust in a sunbeam.

The Ministry of Efficiency, after a flurry of diagnostics that found nothing, classified it as a “transient atmospheric nostalgia-event” and filed it under ‘Resolved/Inconsequential.’ But in the canal park, the dandelions, for that season, grew with clockwork precision at four-thirty in the afternoon, just as the light turned the colour of weak tea. And the children who played there began building forts not for defence, but for the specific acoustics required to amplify a good, dramatic sigh.

Gregor knew this because he read the reports. He read them from a small, grey cubicle on the 214th floor of the Ministry spire, a cubicle that smelled of electrostatic discharge and the faint, enduring tang of boiled peas.
  - He was listed in the system as Scriber-Second Class G. Ror, Anomaly Integration Division. His personnel file was a masterpiece of bland specificity. It noted his satisfactory performance in emotional weather pattern recognition, his adequate tolerance for bureaucratic procedure, and his peculiar, but not inefficient, habit of submitting field reports that included tangential observations on local avian headwear. This was attributed to a minor, non-critical perceptual tic, and was allowed to remain in his record. A perfect, harmless idiosyncrasy. A splash of colour on a grey form. It made him seem more real.

His days were a liturgy of minutiae. He would arrive at his desk, its surface polished to a dull sheen that reflected nothing of interest. He would activate his terminal, which greeted him with a soft chime like a spoon tapping a glass of flat water. His task was to review the raw data-feeds from the civic siphons, flagging any deviations from the mandated emotional climate. The data streamed in: percentages of ruefulness, gradients of ennui, spikes of unlicensed euphoria quickly dampened. He watched the numbers flow, a river of quantified feeling.

And as he watched, he would take from his drawer a single, dried pea. He would place it on the polished grey steel before him. Then, from his pocket, he would produce a tiny felt hat—a different one each day. A minuscule deerstalker. A microscopic beret. A pillbox hat no larger than his thumbnail. Today’s was a stout, homely cloche. With a focus that was the absolute antithesis of efficiency, he would attempt, once per day, to balance the hat upon the pea.

This was the familiar activity. The man from the Ministry had once droned about calibrated melancholy. Gregor had watched a pigeon in a tam o’ shanter. The action was the same: a deliberate, quiet rebellion of attention. But the attitude was fundamentally different. Before, it had been a retreat. A hiding place. Now, it was a practice. A meditation. Each failed attempt—and they always failed, the hat tumbling to the desk with a soft pfft—was a reminder. The world was absurd, unstable, and prone to tipping over. The only sane response was to try, with great care, to place a hat upon it. Not to control it. To acknowledge it.

He was no longer trying to listen to the modem-voice of the Ministry. He was using its drone as a backdrop for his own, quieter signal.

“Scriber Ror?”

The voice was not a modem. It was the sound of a sheet of ice cracking, very politely, across a vast, frozen lake. It belonged to Elara, a newly promoted Logic-Scriber Third Class assigned to his cubicle cluster. She was all sharp angles and fluorescent pallor, as if she’d been grown in a cabinet under administrative lighting. Her efficiency rating was precariously high.

“Yes, Scriber Elara?”

“Your throughput is registering at 98.6% of mean departmental capacity.” She did not look at him as she spoke; her eyes were fixed on her own screen, where three data-streams cascaded like waterfalls of grey ink. “The variance, while within acceptable parameters, is persistent. Is your perceptual tic interfering with your operational tempo?”

Gregor caught the cloche as it fell from the pea for the third time. “The tic is part of the process,” he said, his voice adopting the mild, uninflected tone of the spire. “It allows for a… parallax view of the data. The anomaly is often in the periphery. Not the central reading.”

Elara’s fingers paused over her keyboard. “Parallax,” she repeated, as if tasting a foreign substance. “This is not a recommended analytical protocol.”

“It isn’t a protocol,” Gregor said, placing the pea back in its drawer. “It’s a method. Would you like to see?”

He expected refusal. A tightening of the lips. A return to the waterfalls of grey.

Instead, she swivelled her chair, just a few degrees. Her eyes, the colour of a forgotten puddle, flicked to his now-empty desk, then to the cloche in his hand. “Demonstration does not compromise efficiency,” she stated, a line from some training manual. “Proceed.”

This was not mentoring. Mentoring implied a hierarchy of wisdom. This was more like seeding a crack in permafrost. Gregor opened his drawer again. He took out two peas. He placed them on the desk, a hand’s width apart.

“The official data,” he said, pointing to the left pea. He placed the cloche over it. It sat, perfectly balanced, a little dome of felted order. “Contained. Categorized. Harmonized.”

He then pointed to the right pea. “The anomaly.” He looked at the cloche, then back at the bare pea. He reached into his other pocket and drew out his reserve hat: a tiny, lopsided fez with a threadbare tassel. He placed it on the right pea. It listed to one side, then settled at a precarious, jaunty angle.

“The system sees this,” he said, gesturing to the tidy cloche. “It is designed to see this. A world where everything has a correct hat, and every hat sits straight.” He paused, letting the hum of the ventilation system fill the space. “But the world… is mostly this.” He tapped the fezzed pea. It wobbled. “Off-centre. Improvised. Leaning. The system’s job is to make this,” he pointed to the fez, “look like this.” He pointed to the cloche. “To straighten the tassel. To starch the felt. To ignore the lean.”

Elara stared at the two peas. Her expression did not change, but a minute muscle twitched near her left eye, a signal so faint it would not register on any Ministry monitor. “The anomaly is a failure of harmonization,” she recited, but the words had the texture of ash.

“Or,” Gregor said, his voice dropping to a register just below the ambient hum, a private frequency, “it is a different kind of fact. A story the system hasn’t learned to tell yet. Your three data-streams…” He nodded to her screen. “They tell you the ‘what.’ The quantity of sigh, the density of regret. They don’t tell you the ‘why.’ Why did Mrs. Amsel in Sector 7-G sigh at 3:47 p.m.? Was it because the siphon-output read 62% wistful? Or was it because the light on her kitchen tiles at that exact moment was the same as the light in her grandmother’s pantry, and she suddenly, for no reason she could name, wanted a piece of ginger cake?”

Elara was very still. “Personal narrative is non-productive data. It is noise.”

“It is the only data that matters,” Gregor said softly. He left the peas on the desk. “The system runs on numbers. But people… people run on stories. Even here. Especially here.”

He turned back to his terminal, his demonstration complete. For a long minute, Elara did not move. Then, with a swift, efficient motion, she swivelled back to her console. Her fingers flew over the keys, faster than before. But Gregor, from the corner of his eye, saw her pause. He saw her gaze drift from the central waterfall of data to the smaller, secondary feed—the one that listed location tags, weather cross-references, incidental audio logs. The periphery.

She did not smile. But the frantic tempo of her key-taps slowed, just for a moment, into something that looked almost like thought.

Later that afternoon, a report crossed Gregor’s queue. It was a standard flag from a park siphon in Sector 12-B: a micro-spike of unlicensed contentment. Attached was the automated analysis: Probable cause: solar irradiance variance. Recommended action: none.
Scriber Elara had appended a note. It was strictly factual. Cross-reference: spike coincides with scheduled break of park maintenance operative K. Aural log excerpt: subject heard humming a five-note sequence. Sequence matches no known civic jingle or approved melodic structure. Possibly an idiosyncratic, self-generated motif. No further action recommended.

Gregor read the note. He approved the report. He did not look at Elara. He did not need to. The lesson had been passed. Not to rebel, but to see. To file the official story, and to remember, in a quiet addendum, the true one. The story of a man humming his own tune in the sun. She had documented the anomaly, and in doing so, had protected it. She had become, in her first, tentative step, a curator of leaks.

His own arc, he realized, was complete. He had not come to destroy the machine. He had come to get lost in its guts, to become a whisper in its wiring. He had been a story walking in. Now, he was a story being told, replicated, passed on in hushed addenda and sideways glances. The virus was in the code. It was replicating. It was asking, in the language of data, why the light on the tiles mattered.

At the end of the shift, the grey tide flowed out of the spire’s doors. Gregor moved with it, a shabby pebble in a smooth, grey stream. He stepped out onto the vast plaza. The white sky was deepening to the colour of a dove’s breast, streaked with faint, siphon-made rainbows that cast no shadows.

He did not look back at the needle of polished steel. He looked ahead, across the city. From here, he could see the faint, green smear of the canal park. He could see the geometric districts, the humming sectors, the entire vast and terrible engine of managed feeling.

He felt no grand triumph. No burning purpose. He felt, instead, a profound and settled agency. He was not stagnant. He was integrated. The man who had hidden in a cathedral of irrelevance was now a minor functionary in the cathedral of efficiency. The adventure was not something that had happened to him; it was the lens through which he now saw everything. The pea in the drawer. The hat in his pocket. The unregistered hum in a park. These were not escapes. They were the foundations.

He was no longer waiting for a story to end, or even to continue. He was living inside it, using its grammar to write new, tiny sentences into the fabric of the world. He had hope, but it was not a blazing, inefficient thing. It was a quiet, persistent practice. Like balancing a hat on a pea. You would always fail. You would always try again tomorrow, with a different hat.

He turned his collar up against the breeze—a breeze scrubbed of pollen and passion, carrying only the neutral chill of high altitude. He began to walk, not towards any particular destination, but with a meandering, observational pace. He noted the way the automated street-sweepers moved in a gentle, waltzing rhythm against the curb. He saw a woman on a bench, not smiling the standard-width smile, but simply looking at a cloud, her face a blank page upon which some private, unregulated emotion was being written.

He reached into his pocket. His fingers brushed against the felt of the cloche, the wool of the fez. He pulled out a new one, finished just last night. It was a bicorne, absurdly Napoleonic, crafted from a scrap of grey Ministry-issue sock. He smiled, a small, private, inefficient smile.

He had a report to write tomorrow. A minor glitch in the emotional weather data near the old botanical archives. A trace of unbottled curiosity. He would file it. He would suggest no action. And in the personal notes field, accessible to no one but himself, he would write a single line: The ferns in Hall C appear to be listening.

He walked on, a single, unremarkable man in a worn coat, leaving the heart of the machine behind him for the evening. The story was no longer about breaking in, or breaking out. It was about the quiet, endless, subversive work of keeping things slightly, beautifully off-balance. Of being a trojan horse that had unpacked itself and decided to redecorate.

And as he turned the corner, leaving the plaza, he saw it. On a window ledge of a nondescript administrative annex, pecking at a piece of lichen with measured, rhythmic taps. A pigeon. And on its head, perched at a delightfully rakish angle, was a tiny, perfectly-knitted tam o’ shanter.

It was moss-green.
With a jaunty red bobble.

Gregor did not stop. He did not stare. He simply nodded, as one professional to another, and continued on his way. The signal was being received. And it was being echoed.

The machine had a virus. And the virus was learning to knit.

Chapter 12

FINAL CHAPTER

The man from the Ministry of Efficiency was explaining how the new civic sorrow-siphons would work, and Gregor was trying to listen, but the data-stream on his desk terminal was displaying a tiny, perfectly-rendered tam o’ shanter as its cursor. It was moss-green, with a jaunty red bobble that pulsed gently with each system heartbeat.

“...post-pilot recalibration suggests a ninety-seven percent efficacy in harvesting low-grade, non-specific ennui,” the man droned. He had the voice of a text-to-speech algorithm that had been fed a diet of procedural manuals and mild sedatives. “The residual three percent—the ‘Gregor Anomaly,’ as the internal briefings now call it—remains an acceptable margin of error. For now.”

Gregor nodded, his face a placid mask of bureaucratic attention. He was no longer a field auditor of emotional weather. He was, on paper, a Senior Analyst of Atmospheric Anomalies, a promotion that came with a nicer plant (silk, Ministry-issue) and a deeper access tier to the city’s psychic plumbing. It was a cage made of finer wire. He had expected that. The machine, once aware of a virus, doesn’t destroy it outright. It first tries to understand it. To quantify it. To put it in a box with a clear label.

The man—Designate Alistair-7, according to his nameplate—gestured at the holographic schematic floating between them. It depicted the city’s new emotional grid, a shimmering lattice of light over the street map. Deep blues and purples of harvested sorrow flowed along major conduits to the central processing spire. Flickers of sanctioned, productivity-boosting anxiety (orange) and contented calm (green) were pumped back into residential sectors. It was a circulatory system for the soul of the city. And Gregor’s job was to be its benign, watchful physician.

“Your reports on the botanical archives were… illuminating,” Alistair-7 said, the pause a calculated piece of data itself. “The ‘listening ferns’ hypothesis has been reclassified from ‘Fanciful’ to ‘Pending Resource Allocation for Further Study.’ A team from Botany & Compliance will survey next quarter.”

“I’m sure they’ll find everything in order,” Gregor said, his tone as neutral as the recycled air. He did not smile. Smiles were logged, categorized, and assessed for appropriate context.

After Alistair-7 left, a soft ping echoed in the sound-dampened office. On his terminal, the tam o’ shanter cursor wiggled. A message window opened, not through any official channel, but in a sliver of dead pixel-space Gregor had cultivated like a digital herb garden.

Feeding time. Southeast Quadrant. Conduit 745. The starlings are singing in 4/4 time.

He deleted the window, the pixels dissolving like sugar in water. He stood, collected his worn coat—a relic he’d refused to exchange for a newer, sensor-lined model—and headed out.

Scene 1: The Lingering Thread

The Southeast Quadrant was a district of forgotten utilities: old pumping stations, decommissioned data-hives, the skeletal remains of a public park now just a geometric arrangement of benches and nutrient-drip posts for genetically subdued grass. Conduit 745 was a broad, low pipe of brushed steel, humming with the passage of harvested wistfulness from the nearby residential towers. It was also, as Gregor had discovered, the preferred dining hall for a peculiar flock of starlings.

He arrived as the last of the daylight was being siphoned away by the city’s adaptive photochromic panels, replaced by the uniform, shadowless glow of civic luminescence. On the ground by the conduit’s venting grille was a woman. She was perhaps sixty, her hair a wild cloud of grey held back by a strip of woven conductive thread. She wore the drab coveralls of a Municipal Sanitation Technician, but over them was a shawl of astonishing complexity, a fractal explosion of color that seemed to drink the artificial light and give back something warmer.

Mags. The Knitter of the first hat. The original virus.

She didn’t look up as he approached. Her fingers, gnarled and swift, were working a new creation with a pair of polished carbon-fiber needles. “The anomaly spiked at 16:47,” she said, her voice like gravel and honey. “A collective sigh from Tower Seven. Someone’s anniversary. The wrong one.”

Gregor crouched beside her, watching the grille. A fine, almost invisible mist—the aerosolized, particulate essence of regret—wafted out. The starlings descended, not in a chaotic swarm, but in a precise, rotating formation. They dipped their beaks through the mist, their tiny bodies shuddering with each intake.

“They’re metabolizing it,” Gregor murmured, not for the first time, the wonder still there.

“Transforming it,” Mags corrected, her needles clicking a counter-rhythm to the hum of the pipe. “The sorrow goes in. The song comes out. But the machine hears only rhythm, not melody. It logs their chirps as ‘ambient avian rhythmic patterning, non-threatening.’ It has no category for what the song means.”

“And what does it mean?”

She finally looked at him, her eyes the color of old flint. “It means the stuff they’re bottling is incomplete. It’s the husk. The weight. The birds… they take the weight and leave the memory. The memory becomes the song. The song is a story without words.” She held up her work-in-progress. It was a tiny beret, in a startling shade of cobalt blue. “This is for the data-clerk on the 43rd floor of the Central Spire. The one who routes the happiness metrics. She’s been dreaming in sonnets for three weeks. She thinks it’s a vitamin deficiency.”

Gregor reached into his pocket, past his own collection of miniature hats—his rosary of subversion—and pulled out a small data-sliver. “Alistair-7 mentioned the ‘Gregor Anomaly.’ They’re measuring the three percent leakage. They’re getting closer.”

Mags took the sliver and tucked it into her shawl. “Closer isn’t there. The machine thinks in straight lines. We work in knots.” She nodded towards the starlings, now launching into a synchronized, intricate song that wove around the conduit’s hum. “The system sees a feedback loop of regulated melancholy. It doesn’t see the art. It can’t comprehend a purpose that isn’t utility.”

“They’re launching the next phase,” Gregor said, the technological anxiety a cold stone in his gut. “The siphons were just the harvest. The ‘Eudaemonic Projectors’ are next. Not just siphoning off sadness, but actively projecting state-approved emotional ‘climates’ into public spaces. ‘Invigorating resolve’ for commercial districts. ‘Serene focus’ for schools.”

Mags’s needles stopped. For a moment, the only sound was the hum and the starlings’ complex, stolen-song. “Then we’ll have to learn to knit with light,” she said simply. “And teach the spiders to weave filters.”

The thread from the beginning—the mysterious knitter, the purpose of the hats—was no longer mysterious. It was a network. A slow, patient, textile-based resistance. Gregor was not its leader, nor its sole agent. He was a node. A conduit for information, like pipe 745. Mags was the weaver at the heart of the web, but the web itself was growing, thread by thread, in the hands of a data-clerk dreaming in sonnets, a sanitation worker who coded poetry into waste-flow reports, a gardener who planted seeds in the shape of forbidden questions.

He left her there, a silhouette against the glowing pipe, her needles clicking a manifesto into the twilight.

Scene 2: The Distant Challenge

His walk home was not meandering tonight. It was a patrol. He moved through the city with new senses, seeing not just streets and buildings, but the emotional topography. There, a patch of unnaturally persistent cheer around a new bakery—a beta test for a Eudaemonic projector. Here, a pocket of dampened grief outside a hospice, the raw edges of loss sanded down to a smooth, manageable ache.

He felt the anxiety of it, the profound unwisdom of it all. This was the heart of the technological terror: not the loud, crushing dystopia, but the gentle, smiling sanitization of the human experience. The conviction that every feeling could be measured, graded, harvested, or injected. That the wild, untamed, often painful landscape of the soul was just an inefficient system to be optimized.

He paused on a bridge overlooking one of the concrete canals that channeled rainwater and runoff. Reflected in the dark water were the lights of the Ministry Spire, a needle stitching the sky to the earth. A new challenge crystallized on the horizon, vast and diffuse. It wasn’t a villain to defeat or a wall to scale. It was an atmosphere to breathe. And you cannot fight the air. You can only learn to make your own, in small, clear pockets.

He was unafraid. Not because he was brave, but because the fear had been metabolized, like the starlings with the sorrow. It had been transformed into focus. Into the quiet, meticulous work of a craftsman. The anxiety was the fuel. The virus did not rage against the machine; it simply wrote a more beautiful, inefficient code in the machine’s blind spots.

A public screen flickered to life on a building opposite, displaying the soothing, androgynous face of a Civic Harmony Announcer. “A reminder,” the face said with calibrated warmth, “that the Eudaemonic Projector pilot program launches in Victory Plaza tomorrow at 10 AM. Experience the dawn of a curated emotional landscape. Participation is voluntary, and feedback is appreciated.”

Gregor watched the face, its eyes holding exactly the correct amount of benevolent interest. He thought of the woman on the bench from months ago, the one watching a cloud, her face a blank page. Soon, Victory Plaza would have no clouds. Only a projected, uniform sky of contented blue. And the emotional weather would be set to ‘sunny, with a light breeze of optimism.’

He turned from the screen. He had a different kind of feedback to prepare.

Scene 3: The Honored Artifact

His apartment was a study in sanctioned neutrality. Beige walls. A sofa of durable, cleanable polymer. The one concession, the one symbol of his journey, sat on a simple shelf beside his bed.

It was not a hat.

It was a terrarium. A sealed, glass dome about the size of a human head. Inside was a fragment of the old botanical archives—a piece of gnarled, fossilized wood from a long-extinct fern. Curled around the wood was a slender, living vine he had propagated from a cutting he’d found in Hall C, the one he’d reported as ‘listening.’ The vine was a deep, velvety green. And nestled in its leaves, as if growing there, was a line of his miniature hats. The moss-green tam o’ shanter. The red felt cloche. The blue fez. The grey bicorne. A dozen others, a chronology of quiet rebellion.

This was his altar. His anchor. The machine monitored his data-feeds, his biometrics, his purchase history. But it had no category for a man who kept a piece of rogue botany and a collection of useless, tiny textiles under glass. It registered as ‘decorative hobby: low priority.’

He opened the terrarium’s small port. The air that wafted out was rich, loamy, and alive, a shocking contrast to the sterilized apartment atmosphere. He took the Napoleonic bicorne from his pocket, the one made from a Ministry sock. He placed it gently on the fossilized wood, next to the others.

The change was permanent. He was not the man who had sat through that first Ministry briefing, merely distracted by a pigeon. He was the man who had become the distraction. The anomaly was not a glitch in his report; it was the core of his being. The artifact was no longer a hidden secret in his pocket; it was displayed, honored, integrated into his daily sight. It was a promise he made to himself every morning: to see the world not as the Ministry’s spreadsheet, but as a place where starlings sang stories and ferns listened.

He closed the glass dome. The hats, safe in their tiny, wild world, seemed to watch him back.

Scene 4: The Lasting Peace

The next morning, Gregor went to Victory Plaza for the launch.

A crowd had gathered, a mix of the curious, the compliant, and the genuinely hopeful. They stood under a sky that was, for the moment, its usual self—a pale, indifferent grey. At the center of the plaza was the projector: a sleek, white obelisk, featureless save for a ring of subtle lenses at its apex.

Designate Alistair-7 was at a podium, his voice piped through gentle, omnidirectional speakers. “...a new chapter in civic harmony. Why be at the mercy of unpredictable emotional weather when we can guarantee a climate of positivity and purpose?”

Gregor stood at the very edge of the crowd, near a planter box filled with identical, bloomless shrubs. He was not here to protest. Protest was a recognizable pattern, a data-point of dissent the machine could crush. He was here to observe. To bear witness.

“Activating in three… two… one…”

A soft, golden light emanated from the obelisk. It wasn’t a beam, but a suffusion, like butter melting into the air. A sound followed, a faint, harmonic hum that vibrated in the teeth more than the ears. The grey sky seemed to brighten, not with sun, but with a pervasive, internal glow.

Gregor watched the crowd. Shoulders visibly relaxed. A few people sighed, not with weariness, but with apparent relief. Smiles bloomed on faces, uniform in their pleasantness. The air itself felt lighter, easier to breathe. It was working. It was a masterpiece of psychological engineering. A cage of light and sound.

The technological anxiety within him spiked, a sharp, cold terror. This was it. The final, gentle lock. The end of rainy Tuesdays, of private aches, of the fertile soil where unexpected joy and creativity also grew. It would be an eternal, mild afternoon of the soul.

He closed his eyes against the golden glow. He focused on the cold stone of the planter beneath his fingers. He reached into the pocket of his worn coat, past the data-slivers and the unused transit passes, and found the wool of a newly-finished hat Mags had given him that dawn. It was a simple cap, in a color that had no name—somewhere between twilight and dust.

He opened his eyes. He made himself look, not at the smiling crowd, but at the edges. At the cracks.

There, by the base of the obelisk itself, a single dandelion had pushed through a seam in the perfect plaza concrete. Its yellow head was a screaming, glorious defiance against the curated gold of the projector.

There, on the shoulder of a man beaming with projected serenity, a ladybug landed, a drop of chaotic, primary-color red.

And there, on the highest ledge of the building overlooking the plaza, was a pigeon. It was pecking at something, its head bobbing. And on its head, perched at a delightfully rakish angle, was a tiny, perfectly-knitted tam o’ shanter.

It was moss-green.
With a jaunty red bobble.

Gregor did not stop. He did not stare. He let the full, unprojected wave of feeling wash over him—the anxiety, the awe, the profound and fragile hope. It was a storm in his chest, a messy, human, inefficient hurricane.

He simply nodded, as one professional to another, and turned his back on the golden light.

He walked away from Victory Plaza, not with the stride of a conqueror, but with the steady pace of a gardener returning to his plot. The machine had its projectors. It had its siphons and its metrics and its blissful, hollow peace.

But the machine had a virus. And the virus was learning to knit with light. It was teaching spiders to weave filters. It was writing sonnets in data-streams and growing dandelions in concrete. It was a story told in bird-song and worn in tiny, foolish, beautiful hats.

He reached his street, his building. The golden glow of the plaza was just a faint aura on the horizon here, a false dawn. The emotional weather in his neighborhood was still its own: a bit of damp melancholy from the old woman in 4B, a spike of childish excitement from the kids downstairs, the quiet, contented fatigue of the night-shift worker returning home.

Gregor climbed the stairs to his apartment. He opened the door to the neutral beige and the sterile air. He went straight to the terrarium, to the fragment of wildness under glass. He did not turn on the lights. He sat in the chair beside it, in the gathering natural dusk, and watched the living vine curl around the fossilized fern. He watched the little hats, silent and still in their miniature world.

Outside, the city hummed its tune of perfect efficiency. Inside, a man sat in the dark, smiling a small, private, inefficient smile.

The story was no longer about breaking in, or breaking out. It was about the quiet, endless, subversive work of keeping things slightly, beautifully off-balance. Of being a trojan horse that had unpacked itself, redecorated, and put down roots.

The signal was being received.
And it was being echoed.
